Over the years, technology, social media, music, and trends have changed. But some of us are reminiscing about the good old days with layered clothing and old-school barrettes in our hair.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Justin Bieber Talks About Taking A Break From Music</a></span></p><p>There’s no better way to tune into your emotions than with music. With the rising of Spotify and Apple music, finding the old favorites that we grew up with is a lot easier. Even with old artists taking the stage to sing some of their classics, we’re looking for some new sound from them. Here are 10 2000s pop groups that are due for a comeback.</p><h2 id=blaque>Blaque</h2><p>Some of you may remember this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">girl trio</a> from their hit songs <i>Bring It All To Me </i>or <i>808. </i>These were chart-topping songs that got this girl group’s name out there. At the time, their singles were so hot that the classic Kirsten Dunst film <a href=#><i>Bring It On </i></a>had them hop on board as actresses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These girls were on the scene until about 2004 when they called it quits. Unfortunately in 2012, a member of Blaque, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natina Reed </a>was killed in a car accident at only 32 years of age. Natina’s legacy lives on in the art she left behind.</p><h2 id=outkast>Outkast</h2><p>This duo consisting of André 3000 and Big Boi&nbsp;is well known for&nbsp;its hit songs <i>Hey Ya! </i>And <i>Ms. Jackson. </i>They were iconic in the early 2000s and continued making music until about 2006.</p><p>The two split ways and continued on separate paths. Big Boi went on to release several solo albums. Although Outkast did perform in 2014, the two agreed it didn’t feel right. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a>, André talks about the tour and says that he’s focusing on other projects and that there is no bad blood between these two artists.</p><h2 id=destiny-s-child>Destiny’s Child</h2><p>Arguably one of the biggest girl groups in the world at the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Destiny’s Child</a> held their place in the music industry individually as well as together. Even after the split, <a href=#>Beyoncé Knowles</a> and <a href=#>Kelly Rowland </a>continued to release chart-topping solo records.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The girls remained friends and have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared the stage</a> to play some of their old songs for the 2013 Super Bowl half-time as well as Coachella 2018. Although they have not released any new music and the members continue to pursue their individual projects, Kelly Rowland has recently teased a possible reunion in 2020.</p><h2 id=sugababes>Sugababes</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugababes</a> were a popular British girl group that stayed around all throughout the 2000s. By 2005, the group had earned four UK number one singles. The trio had some issues with keeping members and had a few switches over the years.</p><p>The 2000s were huge on girl groups, especially in the UK, including All Saints and the <a href=#>Spice Girls</a>. The Sugababes are classic and truly an ode to pop culture back in the days. The fall of Sugababes can definitely be pointed to their lack of consistency in the girls. Even their fans had a hard time keeping track of who was coming in or being booted out.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 "One-Hit Wonders" Outside Of The Music Industry</a></span></p><h2 id=lmnt>LMNT</h2><p>If you counted all the boy bands who thrived in the 2000s music era, you’d need a third hand. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LMNT</a> is truly a blast from the past. This boy band created music for just a few years, leaving the scene in 2003. Their hit <i>Juliet </i>was number one on Radio Disney for eight weeks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Member <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Morrison</a> went on to be an actor post break up and is known for his role in <i>Glee </i>as Will Schuester as well as his other roles in other well-known television shows such as <i>American Horror Story </i>and <i>Grey’s Anatomy.</i></p><h2 id=girls-aloud>Girls Aloud</h2><p>Girls Aloud&nbsp;was a British girl group with a successful career until&nbsp;its last tour in 2013. Girls Aloud was a UK staple and made an impact on the music scene. Member Nadine Coyle<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> took to twitter</a> saying that she didn’t approve of the split and she had the best time with the other girls.</p><p>Nadine Coyle explained that the split was messy and she had no say in it. Cheryl has agreed to disagree. Cheryl made other arrangements outside of the band as a member of the judging panel on The X Factor UK.</p><h2 id=allstar-weekend>Allstar Weekend</h2><p>This <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">band</a> had&nbsp;its&nbsp;debut in 2008/2009 on the first season of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio Disney’s</a>&nbsp;<i>The Next Big Thing. </i>The band had a great response from the Disney community and in 2009, the group posted videos of them singing original content. The members did release music prior to 2010, but 2010 was the peak for this band’s career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They went on to perform at Vans Warped Tour and eventually decided to completely rebrand. The band wanted to drop their Disney image and sound and that was the end of Allstar Weekend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Disney Channel Stars Who Were Arrested</a></span></p><h2 id=big-time-rush>Big Time Rush</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Time Rush</a> was a 2009 foursome, jumping on the 2000s boy band bandwagon. The four boys had an immediate response and went on to their own <a href=#>Nickelodeon</a>&nbsp;show&nbsp;thanks to their success. The band not only recorded four seasons of their hit show, but they also did tours and released full albums.</p><p>The boys split up in 2014, going their separate ways. With some married and some with kids, it’s hard to believe that just 10 years ago these boys were Nickelodeon stars. Their fan base still remains to this day, showing the impact this boy band had in the industry.</p><h2 id=panic-at-the-disco>Panic! At The Disco</h2><p>We can all agree that Brendon Urie is one of the most talented performers of the last two decades. Not only is he an amazing vocalist, but he plays the piano, guitar and has performed in live musicals. The original <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Panic! At The Disco </a>was not Brendon Urie solo but included Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, and Brent Wilson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The band started off in 2004 and went on to have hit singles like <i>I Write Sins Not Tragedies </i>and <i>Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off. </i>Over the years, members have left the band, leaving Brendon Urie to carry the name all by himself. As much as we love the new Brendon Urie, an original Panic! At The Disco Reunion would make all of our hearts happy.</p><h2 id=the-cheetah-girls>The Cheetah Girls</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheetah Girls</a>&nbsp;was an iconic trio that dominated the <a href=#>Disney</a>&nbsp;music scene from&nbsp;its debut in 2002 until 2008. With three hit movies and successful soundtracks, The Cheetah Girls were role models for many young girls. The group was all about friendship, empowering women and diversity.</p><p>Members Adrienne Bailon, Kiely Williams, Sabrina Bryan, and Raven Symoné were all different shapes, sizes, and ethnicities but they were all very talented. While all four girls went on to have very different careers, with Adrienne Bailon starring in hit daytime television program, <i>The Real. </i>The girls <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remained friends,</a> meaning a reunion is definitely possible. The world is ready for a “cheetah-licious” comeback in the new decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The 10 Most Successful Boy Band Stars Of All Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrqaTlsGms86roLOdlGR%2FcXyPrGSpp6BitLO71KmqZpylmnqnu9FmmqillZeupLeO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./47-top-zooyouporn-com-alternatives.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="47 Top Zooyouporn.com Alternatives">&larr;
