The next year there was a silly posedown between Ravishing Rick Rude and The Ultimate Warrior. Even better were some of the ridiculous quick promos over the years about how such-and-such wrestler was going to win the match. Plenty of big moments over the years didn’t have a thing to do with actual wrestling.</p><h2 id=the-old-school-opening-video><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Old School Opening Video</span></h2><h3 id=quot-it-39-s-time-to-rumble-it-39-s-time-for-the-royal-rumble-quot>"It's Time To Rumble, It's Time For The Royal Rumble"</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><strong>Hacksaw Jim Duggan won the first ever televised Royal Rumble.</strong></li><li><strong>The match only had twenty men and on the USA Network.</strong></li><li><strong>The event was created to counter-program against Crockett's Bunkhouse Stampede.</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In theory, most fans have heard plenty of Vince impressions over the years and might even have one of their own. You ever get the feeling that you’re going to pop a blood vessel yelling and screaming in that guttural, gnarly growl that The Chairman does? How <a href=#>he never did is certainly a mystery. But it certainly made for some of the early intro videos</a> of The Royal Rumble that much more hysterical. Sure, all he would do is call out the names of the combatants and the other matches, but doing it all with the Vince gusto makes it a hallmark of early WWE.</p><h2 id=lawrence-taylor-laughs-at-bam-bam-bigelow><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Lawrence Taylor Laughs At Bam Bam Bigelow</span></h2><h3 id=the-two-new-jersey-stars-did-not-get-along>The Two New Jersey Stars Did Not Get Along</h3><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>The 1995 Royal Rumble was the first to have celebrity cameos; one from LT and one from Pamela Anderson.</strong></li><li><strong>The winner of the Rumble also won the right to have Pam as a valet for them at WrestleMania.</strong></li><li><strong>This began the push to Lawrence Taylor's first and only wrestling match.</strong></li></ul><p>After Mr. T at the first ever WrestleMania, the next big celebrity match to take place was Bam Bam Bigelow taking on football hero, Lawrence Taylor at WrestleMania 11. At the 1995 Rumble, they began their big feud.

No matter how big The Tribal Chief has gotten, The Architect has always been able to get inside Roman’s mind. At <a href=#>the 2022 event, when Rollins tried to take the Universal title from Roman</a>, he tried to get in Roman’s head right from the entrance.

It took Yoko and about 857 heels to defeat The Phenom, but they did, and The Undertaker was shoved in a box and carted to the locker room.

The <a href=#>2008 Royal Rumble</a> was no different. Emanating from Madison Square Garden, the opening montage was very apropos of the New York commuter lifestyle.

The Ultimate Warrior, then-WWE Champion was called out to the interview stage by the vivacious Sensational Queen Sherri. She dropped all of her “Scary Sherri” veneer and turned on the sultriness. It was all in the name of trying to convince the nincompoop to give a title shot to her man, The Macho Man, should Warrior defeat Sgt. Slaughter. If you don’t remember Warrior’s answer, but remember The Macho King cracking Warrior with his scepter, then you know full well how Warrior answered Sherri’s proposition.</p><h2 id=owen-kicks-bret-rsquo-s-leg-out-of-his-leg><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Owen Kicks Bret’s Leg Out Of His Leg</span></h2><h3 id=bret-was-far-too-selfish-to-tag-owen-in>Bret Was Far Too Selfish To Tag Owen In</h3><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><strong>Re-watch this match.

But his gaffe at the <a href=#>1994 Royal Rumble</a> led to a meme years later. The Rocket got fed up with his brother hogging the spotlight, even after being horrendously injured to the point that The Harts had to forfeit their tag title match against The Quebecers. He then berated Bret for a few moments before kicking The Hitman in his bum leg. During the promo he gave, he told his older brother that Bret was selfish and that’s why “I kicked your leg out of your leg.”</p><h2 id=the-2000-msg-set-up><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The 2000 MSG Set-Up</span></h2><h3 id=as-taste-of-nyc-streets-inside-the-world-39-s-most-famous-arena>As Taste Of NYC Streets Inside The World's Most Famous Arena</h3><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>This was a very ECW influenced show - Taz debuted, The Dudleys had their first major tables match, and Cactus Jack wrestled one of the best matches of his career.</strong></li><li><strong>Cactus Jack made his WWE debut in the Garden, and this was his first WWE title show as Cactus; both matches against Triple H.</strong></li><li><strong>The Rock admitted in 2016 that Big Show really did win the Royal Rumble, and he should have been able to go to WrestleMania to wrestle for the title.</strong></li></ul><p>WrestleMania and several Attitude Era pay-per-views are known for their elaborate stage setups.
