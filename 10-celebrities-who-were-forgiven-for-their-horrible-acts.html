Although he has one-hundred and eight actor credits under his belt, Dutton has a very dark past. At the age of seventeen, he got into a fight and it resulted in the death of the other man involved. Dutton was convicted of manslaughter and was sentenced to seven years in prison. After his release, Charles was arrested again for possession of a deadly weapon and was sentenced to another three years in prison.

In 1987, while vacationing with then girlfriend, <a title="Jennifer Grey Net Worth" href=#>Jennifer Grey</a> in Northern Ireland, Broderick was involved in a fatal car accident. Matthew was driving a rented BMW and crossed into the wrong lane, hitting a Volvo head on.

In June 1987, Madonna went to the hospital after being struck in the head with a baseball bat by Sean. She did not file a report against him, because Penn was already set to serve time for attacking a film extra. The couple were constantly fighting throughout their entire relationship. On December 28, 1989, Sean broke into Madonna's Malibu house, where she was home alone. Madonna attempted to leave, but Sean reportedly tied her up to a chair with twine and an electrical cord. Penn verbally and physically abused her for hours, while taking swigs of liquor out of a bottle. He left the house to get more alcohol and returned a little while later to continue the abuse. After a total of nine hours, Penn untied Madonna after she agreed to perform a sexual act on him. She fled the house to her vehicle and locked herself in the car, while calling the police. Sean banged on the windows of her vehicle, until she drove away. Madonna filed for divorce a week later and withdrew the assault charges against Sean Penn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mrp6qlWKzsL7Goq2epl2bvLN506Gcoqpdnbyzvsibo55lkZjBtHs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-timeline-of-joe-jonas-and-sophie-turner-s-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Timeline Of Joe Jonas And Sophie Turner's Relationship">&larr;
