Her path to superstardom was paved the moment she became a Stark in the north on the popular HBO series <a href=#><i>Game of Thrones</i></a>. Now that she's also been a part of one of the greatest superhero movie franchises in movie history playing Jean Grey/Phoenix in <i>D<a href=#>ark Phoenix</a></i>, the world is, quite frankly, her oyster.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Crazy Details You Never Knew About Lena Headey's Career</a></span></p><p>There is a lot in store for her career-wise, and we can also say that she's a "sucker" for love. But who really is Sophie Turner? That's what we really want to know.Here are ten crazy details and fun facts not all fans know about this young actress.</p><h2 id=sophie-didn-t-debut-alone-in-game-of-thrones>Sophie Didn't Debut Alone In Game Of Thrones</h2><p>Sophie's young career started in 2010 after she was chosen to play Sansa Stark in a TV series by HBO. This was her first-ever gig on the small screen and she was just a 14-year old girl then. Knowing nothing about how TV shows work, she was so young, and she was cast with big stars like her onscreen father Sean Bean, Mark Addy, Lena Headey, and Peter Dinklage.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Surprising Details You Never Knew About Emilia Clarke’s Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But she was not alone in all of this, as she had fellow young actors and first-timers on set like Maisie Williams, Isaac Hempstead Wright, <a href=#>Jack Gleeson</a>, John Bradley, and Kit Harrington to help her out. It's not just young Sansa's first TV show, <i>Game of Thrones</i> was also Arya, Bran, Joffrey, Samwell, and Jon Snow's first-ever TV show.</p><h2 id=sophie-s-best-friends>Sophie's Best Friends</h2><p>The bond that Sophie built with her castmates in <a href=#><i>GOT </i></a>was something rare and special. It's not every day that we can say that we've grown up with a group of people, but this is what happened with Sophie and her best friends from the award-winning show. She grew from a girl to a woman side by side with Bran, Joffrey, and of course Arya.</p><p>Maisie Williams was just a year younger than Sophie when they started acting in <i>GOT</i>. Two girls spending time practically every day would definitely become best friends, and that's exactly what they did. Glamour wrote a nice article about how their friendship affected those around them. Fingers crossed that we'd see them together again in a new project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=similarities-between-sansa-amp-hermione>Similarities Between Sansa & Hermione</h2><p>Sophie Turner's journey in the entertainment world has often been compared to Emma Watson's. The iconic <a href=#>Hermione</a> Granger from the <i>Harry Potter</i> saga is unforgettable, so is her actress Emma Watson. They each had eight seasons of <i>Thrones </i>and eight <i>Potter </i>films, both grow up in England and started their careers as teenagers. Both portrayed the characters, Sansa and Hermione, that are strong and inspiring women.</p><p>The reason why we can't stop listing similarities is because both girls auditioned and got the roles of their careers in their respective schools. Isn't that an amazing coincidence? Sophie couldn’t shake off Sansa's protective instincts back in 2016 as she defended Emma Watson from a very distasteful tabloid article as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-married-a-jonas-brother>She Married A Jonas Brother</h2><p>The man who tamed this Stark direwolf is named Joe from the nearby land of music from the proud House called Jonas Brothers. The young couple had a lot of common friends and these friends have been wanting one to meet the other. Joe Jonas finally sent a direct message to Sophie on <i>Instagram</i>, then a little over a year later the two were engaged.</p><p>Joe definitely moves faster than Joffrey, Ramsay, and Tyrion combined, well, he had the advantage of social media instead of ravens. An <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">article by Elle</a> covers the details of the couple's wedding in France. Yes, they were married in Vegas and again in France. Luckily for them and their guests, neither of the two ceremonies were ‘red weddings.’</p><h2 id=husbands-finales-amp-ndas>Husbands, Finales & NDAs</h2><p>Ever since Sophie and Joe tied the knot, we can only assume that they've been talking daily about their busy day. Joe Jonas visited the shooting location of <i>GOT </i>a lot, so much so that the visits prompted the executives to serve a non-disclosure agreement, fiance version.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Crazy Details You Never Knew About Peter Dinklage's Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The pivotal ending to arguably the greatest story ever told on TV can't be spoiled by Sansa's real-life husband-to-be, so the bigwigs had to be sure. We're even more sure that Jonas caught up with the scenes he's watched and knew how the story was going to end... for some parts at least. Sophie shared the story of the NDA signing in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Entertainment Tonight</i></a>.</p><h2 id=she-can-t-keep-a-secret>She Can’t Keep a Secret</h2><p>As Joe Jonas was signing his NDA, we imagine him laughing about a little secret he knew about his wife Sophie, that being that she can't really keep secrets. She admitted to this in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a>, revealing that a few of her friends knew the ending of <i>Game of Thrones</i> even before it aired. She also said that she only shares it with her closest friends, the ones that she knows would keep the secret.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We guess her sister-in-law and fellow actress Priyanka Chopra knew the ending. She would have beaten it out of her <i>Quantico </i>style, but we already know Sophie is not a good secret-keeper. Even with the Starbucks cup fiasco, she was the first to reveal the inside scoop. Speaking of which...</p><h2 id=that-starbucks-coffee-cup-fiasco>That Starbucks Coffee Cup Fiasco</h2><p>It was in episode 4 of season 8 that the most famous Starbucks to-go coffee cup in the world appeared in <a href=#><i>Game of Thrones</i></a>. But after all the jokes and memes about it were said, no one knew which Winterfell resident had access to a time machine and brought back a 2019 beverage to the Seven Kingdoms. Well, that was until Sophie Turner spilled the (coffee) beans!</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>'s article reports that Sophie revealed in an appearance on Conan that the displaced coffee cup was Kit Harrington's. She then explained to Conan O'Brien why it's not hers and was actually Emilia Clarke's. In case you were wondering, Sophie's undeniable proof had something to do with corsets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-throne-of-accolades>A Throne Of Accolades</h2><p>Sophie Turner is still relatively young by Hollywood standards, but her achievements are no joke. She's been an integral character in the greatest TV series of this generation and was a lead character at a time when superhero movies are a staple in cinemas. Not a lot of 23-year olds have that on their resume. Awards and recognition wise, she's had her fair share of accolades but she's yet to crack the biggest ones in TV and film.</p><p>Saying that now, Turner's most important nomination was in 2016 when she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Best Supporting Actress as listed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Hollywood Reporter</i></a>. She's won four other awards including Best UK TV Actress from <i>Glamour </i>and an Ewwy Award for Best Supporting Actress.</p><h2 id=she-will-be-a-box-office-phoenix>She Will Be A Box Office Phoenix</h2><p>When movies flop these days, we can't really see that it did, take for example <i>Dark Phoenix, </i>her first leading role in a film. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Box Office Mojo</i></a>, it only grossed $252 million worldwide against a budget of $200 million. Locally speaking, it tanked and earned only $65 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was technically a disaster, but everybody in Hollywood is saying it will not affect her career. After all, Sophie is still a powerhouse and will remain to be such for the near future. Like her mutant character's famous rise from the ashes, Turner will come back strong and make another name for herself; superhero, orphaned daughter, or otherwise.</p><h2 id=sansa-transitions-to-jane>Sansa Transitions To Jane</h2><p>Speaking of a return, Sophie Turner is already on a new TV project, <i>Survive</i>. Her character is Jane and she’ll be seen with co-star Corey Hawkins from <i>24: Legacy</i> and Spike Lee's <i>BlacKkKlansman</i>. We all know him as Dre in <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, so this guy alone makes Sophie's new show very exciting.</p><p>The new show is also premiering in a new video platform called <i>Quibi</i>. This <i>Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, </i>and <i>Crackle</i>-like platform is going to launch next year and we are expecting Turner's show to be the flagship show. We are just excited to see Sophie and Corey in totally different roles, here's an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">article from Variety</a> sharing more details about the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Crazy Details You Never Knew About Maisie Williams' Career</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5no6S9qbXEZquuqp6av26v0ZqxsmWUmsGitcusZJqan6rBbrTEq2ScmaKasrN7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./12-celebrities-who-never-crack-a-smile.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 Celebrities Who Never Crack A Smile">&larr;
