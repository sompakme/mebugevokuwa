Of course, everyone knows that Kim has been married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a> since 2014 but who was Kim dating before the famous rapper?</p><h2 id=nick-lachey><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Nick Lachey</span></h2><p>Kicking the list off is actor and musician Nick Lachey whom plenty of millennials remember as a member of the 90s boyband 98 Degrees as well as singer&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Simpson</a>‘s ex-husband.</p><p>Kim Kardashian and Nick Lachey actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">briefly dated in 2006</a> after his split from Jessica, and in an interview on watch Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen&nbsp;the actor&nbsp;even&nbsp;revealed that the two&nbsp;went on a date to see The Da Vinci Code.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=50-cent><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>50 Cent</span></h2><p>Next on the list is rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent</a> who was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored to be dating</a> Kim Kardashian in August of 2009. At the time, the two stars were frequently seen together at different star-studded events and they certainly always seemed very flirtatious with each other.</p><p>Of course, as fans of the reality television star already know, Kim eventually went for another famous rapper meaning that 50 Cent just remained one of her famous exes we all forgot about!</p><h2 id=nick-cannon><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Nick Cannon</span></h2><p>Another famous face that used to date Kim Kardashian is comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Cannon</a>. Nick and Kim dated from September 2006 to January 2007, and yes — the sharp eye will notice that during that time the reality television star was also linked to Nick Lachey and 50 Cent.</p><p>In an interview on The Howard Stern Show, Nick Cannon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confessed</a> that he actually broke up with Kim Kardashian because she lied about a certain infamous tape that was leaked...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cristiano-ronaldo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Cristiano Ronaldo</span></h2><p>The only athlete that made it onto this list is Portuguese professional soccer player <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> — most people remember Kim Kardashian's short-lived marriage to basketball player Kris Humphries.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Pics Showing The Evolution Of Paris Hilton And Kim Kardashian’s Friendship</a></span></p><p>While there are no photos of Kim and Cristiano together, the two were linked to each other back in 2010, right before Kim started dating Kris Humphries.

The two stars were linked to each other back in 2006, and just like with 50 Cent — Kim was also frequently seen hanging out with The Game at different events.</p><p>While the reality television star never confirmed her relationship with the rapper, he frequently stated that the two were more than just friends — and he even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rapped about Kim K</a> in one of his songs!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gabriel-aubry><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Gabriel Aubry</span></h2><p>In 2010 Kim Kardashian was dating Canadian model Gabriel Aubrey who had just gotten separated from Hollywood star Halle Berry. After the two stars were spotted cozying up courtside at a basketball game it was pretty evident that Kim and Gabriel were a thing.</p><p>Unfortunately, their relationship didn’t last for too long as they broke up after only two months — allegedly because Halle Berry <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn't too happy</a> about their romance!</p><h2 id=benji-madden><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Benji Madden</span></h2><p>Next on the list is yet another musician — this time we're talking about guitarist and singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Benji Madden</a>.
