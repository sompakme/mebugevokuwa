Whether it is looks, personality, gravitas, or just plain sexiness, someone who appeals to one person may not appeal at all to another. It is the old adage, "to each their own." With that said, men have a set of criteria we go by when being attracted to someone of the opposite sex. First off, one man's&nbsp;trash may be another man's treasure. And old corny sayings aside, stereotypes&nbsp;normally hold&nbsp;true. Everyone has a particular type they are interested in. And although every man may vary on the particulars of what gets him going, the unspeakable attraction between two people cannot be simply categorized down to butts and boobs. However, each man has his own specific criteria that impacts his attractions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Image is a big part of this attraction. A man looks at a woman and is sometimes undeniably attracted to her. Breast size is a part of it. Eye color, hair color, legs, butt, facial beauty, hair style, etc.... There is a long list of items that may impact this attraction. However, when you talk about celebrity fantasies, much like with the normal women men&nbsp;are attracted to, there are criteria that even the men themselves have difficulties talking about. Of course, one thing is for certain, fantasies are fun and they usually don't&nbsp;come true. But that doesn't stop men from dreaming of the good times we could be having with beautiful celebrity women. And some women, the select few, are so beautiful, crazy, or powerful, that they reach the highest level of hope in a man's fantasy reel. Extreme beauty can be intimidating. A high level of intelligence can be intimidating. Just plain crazy can be intimidating. But it doesn't stop the fantasies from rolling in! With that said, we name the 15 intimidating celebrities&nbsp;men fantasize about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-mariah-carey><strong>15. Mariah Carey</strong></h2><p>There is no doubting that this extraordinary diva is one of the most soulful, talented, high-maintenance creatures to ever walk the globe. <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> is known for her looks, her singing voice, and her fiery personality. There is little to hold Carey back in this world as she is a bona fide living legend. Carey has been known to be extremely difficult. Word of her explosive personality and chaotic behaviors can be summed up by her desire to make love to the sound of her own voice. That's right, imagine you are with this amazing talent, her amazing medically enhanced body near you, and in order to get intimate you have to put on her greatest hits. I don't think there is anything quite as intimidating in this world. Her ability to start fights with anyone and everyone around her in order to have her way led to her demise with the lovable <a href=#>Nick Cannon</a>. He speaks little over her controlling ways- perhaps from fear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-nicki-minaj><strong>14. Nicki Minaj</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Nicki Minaj </a>grew up in the streets of New York and she carries a giant chip on her shoulder everywhere she goes. The rapper and R&B sensation makes no qualms about her bad attitude. She has picked up and body slammed <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> backstage at an awards show for talking smack about her. She has engaged in a very public feud with Mariah Carey on American Idol. In addition to her fights and feuds, Minaj drops lyrics with extreme confidence and vulgarity. She is sassy and twerks with ferocity. Make no mistake about it, Minaj has as street-mentality that she has ridden into rare air. Very few women have become as successful as she has in an industry dominated by men and the exploitation of women. But Minaj has risen above almost everyone. She also is fierce in every aspect of what she does. Her sex appeal (and numerous surgeries), have led her to showcase a sinful body that is pleasant to the eye complimented by a wicked attitude that would scare off any man.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-angelina-jolie><strong>13. Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> has long had an impact on our lives and the drama surrounding this exotic beauty continues to grow. It all started long ago when Jolie had an odd exchange at an award show and a strange, long kiss with her brother. In addition to that odd occurrence, she and <a href=#>Billy Bob Thornton</a> decided to exchange each other's blood in vials they wore around one another's necks. Then of course we get the most recent <a href=#>Brad Pitt </a>and Angelina Jolie chaos. They got together courtesy of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, when Pitt was still married to <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>. Then came all the kids and the subsequent divorce papers. We don't know about Jolie's sanity, but we certainly know about her hotness. She uses her Tomb Raider figure and incredible "sexy cat" eyes to her advantage. She is a dark, beautiful woman who would completely scare the crap out of most men in bed, but is too enticing not to want.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-taylor-swift><strong>12. Taylor Swift</strong></h2><p>We know that many people will tilt their head and think, "Really, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> intimidating?" Well, "America's Sweetheart" has taken down some pretty impressive men with her lyrics and you do not want to be on the wrong side of her ire when it comes to her passionate love lyrics. When you combine Taylor Swift's popularity along with her dynamic worldwide success, it can be pretty intimidating to be the guy standing in her VERY long shadow. Swift is beautiful and beloved by millions upon millions of adoring fans all across the globe. So if you ever see yourself being by her side, expect to be sharing her attention with the world. On top of that, you know she has pretty strong pull in her day. The wholesome image is nice, but Swift is still a woman who has dated an impressive list of celebrities. On top of that pressure, you gotta be thinking about her desire to have a "ring put on it." Needless to say, Swift and her empire worth a few hundred million dollars can be pretty intimidating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-madison-rayne><strong>11. Madison Rayne</strong></h2><p>Girl + Incredible Body + Wrestler + Did We Mention The Body?!? = hot and intimidating. Or as we call her, Madison Rayne. Make no mistake about it, Rayne is not a girl you want to cross up. She carries a toughness and ruggedness that makes you not want to mess with her. She is the kind of woman we can see picking up your laptop and smashing it over your head when you click on the newest (and supposedly accidental)<a href=#> Kim Kardashian </a>nude pic floated on the web. Madison Rayne obviously has the intimidating thing down just by virtue of her being a wrestler. When you throw on the ripped and sexy body, she is one of the most intimidating figures out there. Her sexiness and the danger involved most likely bring men back wanting more. And we can certainly see why. We look forward to more&nbsp;TNA action from this sexy&nbsp;wrestling star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-serena-williams><strong>10. Serena Williams</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Serena Williams </a>is one of the most powerful and successful tennis players of all time. Serena Williams is the younger sister of the power sister duo, <a href=#>Venus</a> and Serena or as the world knows them as: The Williams Sisters. These two sisters have dominated the tennis world for more than a decade. Their play has been highlighted by power, their size and strength aiding in the domination of&nbsp;their opponents. Serena's fame has extended far beyond the tennis court and she has begun to hit some runways. Her modeling career may not be her bread-and-butter, but Williams has drawn the attention of many men with her busty figure and delectable behind. But with pretty impressive muscles, one would have to be just a bit intimidated to jump into the metaphorical sack with the younger Williams sister.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-hilary-rowland><strong>9. Hilary Rowland</strong></h2><p>What happens when you are a very successful woman who makes hundreds of millions of dollars? Well, you are powerful and intimidating to the opposite sex. Throw in sexy and beautiful and you are Hilary Rowland.&nbsp;Many people in the "regular" world may look at this name and say, "who the heck is Hilary Rowland?" But if you are a tech geek, you probably&nbsp;have your lotion and toilet paper ready, because Rowland is one of the tech world's greatest treats. The programmer is a blonde hottie who started her own companies,&nbsp;eClick Interactive and NewFaces.com at the age of 15! From there, she has only gone up&nbsp;and her look is stunning. This curvaceous beauty is the hottest tech programmer since <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> played one in the movie Hackers. Of course, every tech geek (and others) may lose their mind around her as this successful techie has game beyond most hackers out there. Check out her goods!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-maria-sharapova><strong>8. Maria Sharapova</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Maria Sharapova</a> is one of tennis's legends. The 6-footer has dominated tennis along with the likes of the Williams sisters. In addition to her amazing tennis game, Sharapova is a stunning, tall, blonde beauty who regularly models. The Russian born superstar is everything <a href=#>Anna Kournikova</a> couldn't be for the world: a beautiful Russian woman who can also win tennis championships. Sharapova has a well-earned her reputation as being both hot and successful. As her tennis days wind down, she will have no problem continuing her reign of success through business and modeling. The Russian beaut is building her own Kremlin empire and Russian men, as well as others all around the world, dream about this wonder. Make no mistake about it, this model-like beauty is tall, gorgeous, and probably protected by the Russian elites (aka the Russian mob). So, dream quietly about her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-kate-middleton><strong>7. Kate Middleton</strong></h2><p>British men are rejoicing with their number one fantasy number. <a href=#>Kate Middleton</a> is the talk of all the British tabloids. This beautiful brunette grabbed England's (and the world's) attention when <a href=#>Prince William</a>, the duke of Cambridge, extended a marriage proposal and she became the Duchess back in 2011. The Brits love their Royals and this beauty is just another reason for them to get excited. Born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in&nbsp;Reading, Berkshire, Middleton has been vaulted into the spotlight as a prime candidate to become Queen of England some day. Her husband, William, is second in line to take over for the current (and ageless Queen Mother). With Royal implications abounding, Middleton is&nbsp;one of the most&nbsp;powerful figures in England.</p><h2 id=6-sofia-vergara><strong>6. Sofia Vergara</strong></h2><p>This Colombian fireball burst onto the scene with an impressive display of sexy photos that spread like wildfire on the Internet. Then came her role on the hit television series Modern Family. Since then&nbsp;<a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a> has pitched everything and anything on television. Vergara can seen all over American television now after being a South American sensation for years.&nbsp;The bountiful Vergara is known for her amazing physical features, i.e. her large breasts, small waist, and attractive rear end.&nbsp;She sports the ultimate hourglass appearance to go along with a beautiful face and a sassy personality. This beautiful and intimidating Colombian, both with her looks and her personality, is a dynamite fantasy for many a man all across the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-rihanna><strong>5. Rihanna</strong></h2><p>When thinking about <a href=#>Rihanna</a>, the word "badass" comes to mind. Make no mistake about it, this highly talented singer came from the Caribbean to light the world on fire with her sultry and beautiful voice. In addition to her sexy vocals, she sports a beautiful sleek figure that she is more than happy to expose again and again. Rihanna wears revealing clothing no matter where she is. Whether she is modeling or just taking a few selfies, you can guarantee one thing- Rihanna showcases her beautiful body. Her tattoos are always present in her&nbsp;photos and the sultry singer from Saint Michael, Barbados has racked up a net worth of nearly $200 million during her career. She also seems like a complete wildcat. With albums like Good Girl Gone Bad, the name alone about sums up Rihanna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-beyonc-knowles><strong>4. Beyoncé Knowles</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Beyoncé Knowles </a>is going to be known as the "Queen B" for all-time. The R&B sensation burst onto the scene as the key cog in the girl super-group Destiny's Child. From there, the woman simply knowns as "Beyoncé" has become an absolute sensation. Beyoncé has conquered the world as a solo artist and her beauty is unmatched. Beyoncé may be best known for two things: her incredibly beautiful face and her bodacious behind. The combination has turned Beyoncé into a legend. Her status only gained with her merger with <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>. The marriage has enabled Beyoncé to further her brand and her continued dominance of the R&B industry. And of course, the Queen B is stunning and the fantasy of millions of men across the world. She also is powerful and her behind is worthy of the hall of fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-yao-chen><strong>3. Yao Chen</strong></h2><p>China rises with this sexy, powerful number. Yao Chen isn't just any ordinary actress. China is one of the biggest forces in the world. Born in Shishi City, Quanzhou, Fujian province in China, Chen started her film career in 2005 after graduating from the Beijing Film Academy. In 2010, Chen won the Golden Eagle Award for Best Actress. In a short period of time, Chen has become the equivalent of Chinese royalty due to her extraordinarily high status. In 2014, Chen had become so popular that Forbes listed her as the 83rd most powerful woman in the entire world. Her influence cannot be understated, despite not being well known in the western world. An absolute beauty, Chen is a dream for Chinese men while also being&nbsp;one of the most powerful, influential women in the world.</p><h2 id=2-kate-upton><strong>2. Kate Upton</strong></h2><p>One of the most attractive women in the world to many, <a href=#>Kate Upton</a> has graced the cover of Sports Illustrated's&nbsp;Swimsuit Issue multiple times. She is an absolute goddess. Her beautiful amazing blonde hair, incredible smile, and bountiful figure have made an amazing impact on the world in a very short period of time. Ever since Upton appeared in a Carl's Jr. commercial wearing little clothing, the then 18-year-old budding star has skyrocketed with her modeling. She isn't a classic model, with a tall frame and thin physique. Instead she uses her double-D breasts as a weapon with nearly every outfit she wears. Combine that with her creamy white skin and devilishly inviting smile, and Kate Upton is a modern day calendar girl that makes more waves than the Atlantic Ocean. We are quite certain that her reputation and amazing beauty would scare any average man away from a conversation as most are left speechless by this goddess...and for good reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-ronda-rousey><strong>1.&nbsp;Ronda Rousey</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Rhonda Rousey</a> is an absolute phenomenon. Her tremendous appetite for cage fighting has led her to become the absolute people's champion, and by people's champion, we mean men all across the world. The&nbsp;fighter has become a world-renowned celebrity for her <a href=#>Mike Tyson</a>-like destruction of her opponents while at the same time being just sexy enough to pull off a lot of male-inviting poses. When you add in her fantastic modeling photos, she has been catapulted into being one of the most desired women around. However, much like Turtle found out on Entourage, Rousey is not a&nbsp;beautiful woman you want to mess with because she can literally kick your ass. Either way, Rousey is sexy and definitely powerful and intimidating, landing her at our top spot!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2eu7W1zKKbmqyZo7Ruw86mnKdlkaG5brnEp2SfmZ6prrS12Z5kmpqfqsFurdNmpaKfmKl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./90-day-fiance-s-chantel-everett-took-pedro-jimeno-s-virginity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="90 Day Fiance's Chantel Everett Took Pedro Jimeno's Virginity">&larr;
