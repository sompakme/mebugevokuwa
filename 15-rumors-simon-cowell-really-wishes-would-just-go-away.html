Keep it clean now. Arrogant? Demanding? Rude? Yes to all of that. But over the last six years or so, three things have happened that have resulted in a shift in the attitude of the man. The first was the birth of his only child, his son Eric six years ago. And the second? It was the death of his 89-year-old mother, Julie, five years ago. And, of course, there is the now long-standing relationship with Lauren Silverman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, we're not going to say he's turned into some kind of a boy scout, but the man now actually apologizes when he screws up. Imagine that 10 years ago? No way. And he does charity work. And we're not just talking donating money, but rather turning up and holding hands and chatting. He is, at his core, the same ole Simon, with just a touch of mellow and nice. Maybe turning 60 has something to do with it.&nbsp;Who knows?&nbsp; Here are 15 rumors that Simon Cowell wishes would quietly just go away.</p><h2 id=he-set-out-to-steal-lauren-silverman-from-her-husband><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>He Set Out To Steal Lauren Silverman From Her Husband</span></h2><p>It was 2009 and Cowell was hanging out on his bestie Andrew Silverman's yacht with Silverman and his wife Lauren. One thing leads to another and Lauren ends up pregnant with Simon's child. It just happened. It was not planned. Now, he loves Lauren. He loves his son Eric. But, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has said of the episode</a>, "I can't hold my head up about it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-stole-the-idea-for-the-x-factor><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>He Stole The Idea For The X-Factor</span></h2><p>TV producer Simon Fuller came up with the idea for&nbsp;Pop Idol. Simon Cowell was a judge. Later, Simon Cowell comes up with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Factor</a>.&nbsp;Like&nbsp;Pop Idol,&nbsp;it crowned the "best" rock singer. Fuller sued, saying Cowell had stolen his idea. Cowell agreed to an out of court settlement. In other words, maybe there was something in what Fuller said. Maybe there wasn't. Who cares? The two Simons both got mega-rich.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Factor: 20 Strict Rules The Judges Have To Follow</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-only-out-for-himself><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>He's Only Out For Himself</span></h2><p>A few years back, Simon and Lauren turned up to a fundraiser for a charity called Together for Short Lives. Simon's sitting on stage while they run a video of his visiting terminally ill children, just hanging out and talking. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He starts tearing up</a> and Lauren has to rush up onto the stage to make the speech he was supposed to have made. Not such a tough guy after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=judge-rita-ora-is-the-friend-of-man-who-burgled-simon-s-house><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Judge Rita Ora Is The Friend Of Man Who Burgled Simon's House</span></h2><p>A while back, a guy called Darren February burgled Simon Cowell's house. So? Well, he comes from the same council estate (project housing) that singer Rita Ora grew up in. She, literally, came up from nothing. Some tabloid journalists with nothing better to do decided to say <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darren and Rita were friends</a>. The story was so dumb that Rita just said get over it guys.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Shady Things Everyone Chooses To Ignore About Rita Ora</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-cold-and-heartless><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>He's Cold And Heartless</span></h2><p>Is there really a "new" Simon Cowell? Well, according to&nbsp;Britain's Got Talent&nbsp;judge&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Holden</a>, "He’s turned into something quite spiritual . . . it’s really unnerved me. He’s being really nice." Like where is Simon and what have you done with him? Meanwhile, in America,&nbsp;America's Got Talent Announces&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sofia Vergara will be a judge. </a>Yeah!</p><h2 id=he-once-filed-for-bankruptcy><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>He Once&nbsp;Filed For Bankruptcy</span></h2><p>Simon moved back in with his parents when he was 30-years-old. As a 20-something he had been determined to make a career in record production. He had a few successes, but more failures. As a result, in 1989 he had no money and was forced to move back home. But he never filed for bankruptcy. Today?&nbsp; The Syco Entertainment owner is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$600 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-queen-thinks-he-is-a-dreadful-man><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The Queen Thinks He Is A Dreadful Man</span></h2><p>We can refute that one outright! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The&nbsp;X -Factor&nbsp;</a>is one of her favorite shows, alongside&nbsp;Downton Abbey&nbsp;and&nbsp;Eastenders.&nbsp;Sure, she disagrees with the judges sometimes, but she would hardly be a regular watcher if she thought Simon terrible. By the way, she does a running commentary on&nbsp;Downton Abbey&nbsp;correcting the historical inaccuracies. Nobody dares to tell her to be quiet.</p><h2 id=he-s-the-star-of-any-show-he-is-on><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He's The Star Of Any Show He Is On</span></h2><p>There are producers and there are stars. Simon Cowell is very much a producer type. Sure, he's got the kind of personality that looms large on judging panels, but his "thing" is really in the production end of things. He has come out and said he does not, not, not consider himself a star. So, what about the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame? Accident, we guess. Eric had a great time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=was-he-telling-the-truth-about-what-happened-when-he-fell><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Was He Telling The Truth About What Happened When He Fell?</span></h2><p>In 2018, Simon Cowell <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fell down the stairs</a> at his home. He said it was due to overwork, stress, and low blood pressure. He had simply fainted and taken a tumble. And he has said it was a wake-up call, that he had been working too hard. But was that really all there was to it? Some say not. Simon insists it was due to overwork and stress. Others wonder.</p><h2 id=his-father-bought-simon-s-way-into-the-music-business><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>His Father Bought Simon's Way Into The Music Business</span></h2><p>No way. Well in 1979 his father Eric, an EMI executive, took pity on him and got him a job in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">EMI mailroom</a>! It didn't last. He then worked as a runner for Elstree Studios and ended up working on the Jack Nicholson film&nbsp;The Shining,&nbsp;where one of his jobs was to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">polish Nicolson's famous ax!</a>&nbsp;You won't believe it, but he fell out with his bosses and quit!</p><h2 id=he-s-stubborn-and-hard-headed><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He's Stubborn And Hard Headed</span></h2><p>What's the difference between being certain and resolute and stubborn and hard-headed? Not a lot. It's all in the attitude. Ten years ago, Cowell was stubborn, hard-headed, hot-headed even. Now, as people like Amanda Holden have noticed, he's mellowed. Make no mistake, he's still the boss, he's still in charge. But according to Amanda, he's actually listening to what others say. Is this really Simon Cowell?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Simon Cowell When He Thought No One Was Watching</a></span></p><h2 id=he-s-proud-of-giving-susan-boyle-a-hard-time-in-her-2009-audition><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He's Proud Of Giving Susan Boyle A Hard Time In Her 2009 Audition</span></h2><p>When Susan Boyle, looking lumpy, and old-maidish, strutted onto&nbsp;Britain's Got Talent&nbsp;stage in 2009, you could see Simon Cowell (and most of the audience) snicker. Simon gave her a hard time for saying she was the next Elaine Paige.&nbsp; But when she sang, the snickering stopped, and the jaws dropped. Simon has since said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sorry to Susan</a>. Yes, Simon, you were a rude crude.</p><h2 id=little-mix-left-his-label-because-he-messed-them-about><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Little Mix Left His Label Because He Messed Them About</span></h2><p>Little Mix won&nbsp;X -Factor UK&nbsp;in 2011 and (of course) went on to sign with Simon Cowell's Syco Music. Fast forward to 2018 and the girl group gets cut loose by Cowell, ending up at RCA Records. They say they were messed about, treated badly. Cowell's version? He says they were <a href=#>making demands</a>, dissing staff, and asking for songwriting credit they didn't deserve. You know, the usual diva thing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=actor-singer-robson-green-hates-his-guts-for-dissing-his-wife><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Actor/Singer Robson Green Hates His Guts For Dissing His Wife</span></h2><p>Back in the 1990s, Robson Green (Granchester) &nbsp;working with Simon Cowell, recorded "Unchained Melody". It made Simon his first million. But both Green and Simon had the hots for the same woman and Green married her. Green has objected to comments Cowell has made about his wife, but calls him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hard-working and giving</a>. So a mixed bag really.</p><h2 id=the-nasty-feud-with-singer-olly-murs><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Nasty Feud With Singer Olly Murs</span></h2><p>Headlines screamed "Feud between singer and his former mentor". Seems Simon had wanted English pop idol Murs for the&nbsp;X-Factor and he went to&nbsp;The Voice.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forget it Olly has said.&nbsp;</a>There's no feud.&nbsp;Olly first sprang to prominence on the&nbsp;X -Factor UK.&nbsp;Simon was a big part of his success. He's mega in the U.K. these days.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 15 Times Simon Cowell Was As Savage AF</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhobmWiqrqwvtJmqqKln6N6pLvWnqOlZaKarq242GauoquYmsBuw86uo51lmqrAtXnGqGSar5GufA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./5-things-you-didn-t-know-about-alyson-hannigan-and-her-husband.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Things You Didnt Know About Alyson Hannigan and Her Husband">&larr;
