Released in 1991, it was based on the novel by the same name by Thomas Harris, and was directed by Jonathan Demme.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins providing career-shaping roles, the film was one of the biggest winners at the Academy Awards, taking home five Oscars, including the Best Picture of the Year. The film is considered a classic in the psychological horror genre, and was the inspiration for television spinoff series, Hannibal.</p><p>Now, twenty years after the film's release, a new series is in the works to bring the story of FBI agent Clarice Starling to the forefront. Set one year after the events that happened in the film, it will air on CBS sometime in late 2020.</p><h2 id=it-will-be-called-clarice><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>It Will Be Called Clarice</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Clarice.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The title of the show will be Clarice,&nbsp;an homage to the brainy FBI detective that was an integral part of the film and a show of who the series will really focus on. The original film starred Jodie Foster in the role, and Julianne Moore played her in the 2001 film Hannibal.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=it-will-take-place-one-year-after-the-events-of-silence-of-the-lambs><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>It Will Take Place One Year After The Events Of&nbsp;Silence Of The Lambs</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Silence-Of-The-Lambs.jpg><p>The television series will take place in 1993, one year after the events that transpired in the original Silence of the Lambs&nbsp;film. New cases are likely to present themselves in the show, and it's possible that Hannibal Lecter will make an appearance as well considering his evolving relationship with Clarice in the novel continuity.</p><h2 id=anthony-hopkins-will-not-be-making-an-appearance><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Anthony Hopkins Will Not Be Making An Appearance</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Anthony-Hopkins.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the fact that the Hannibal Lecter storyline will probably be tied into the show in some way, shape, or form, Anthony Hopkins will definitely not be signing on to the cast. At 82 years old, the popular actor has recently announced his retirement from the business.</p><h2 id=we-don-t-know-who-will-play-clarice-starling><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>We Don't Know Who Will Play Clarice Starling</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Julianne-Moore-1.jpg><p>Though the creators of the show probably have some good ideas of who they would like to cast as Clarice, no official statements have been made to confirm who will be playing the role. We expect some updates in the next several months, as filming is scheduled to start pretty soon!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-series-will-be-produced-by-mgm><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Series Will Be Produced By MGM</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MGM.jpg><p>The series will be produced by giant MGM Studios, as well as Alex Kurtzman's personal own television and film production company, Secret Hideout. The producer founded the company in 2014, and it has since produced&nbsp;the most recent films in the modern Star Trek franchise.</p><h2 id=it-will-be-written-by-alex-kurtzman-and-jenny-lumet-who-are-also-putting-out-the-man-who-fell-to-earth><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>It Will Be Written By Alex Kurtzman And Jenny Lumet, Who Are Also Putting Out 'The Man Who Fell To Earth'</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Alex-Kurtzman.jpg><p>Producers Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet have worked together on several projects, and seem to be on a roll with television series this year. They are also collaborating on an adaptation of the novel, The Man Who Fell To Earth, which is coming to CBS All Access this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-is-the-second-attempt-to-release-a-series-about-clarice><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>This Is The Second Attempt To Release A Series About Clarice</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Clarice-Starling-1.jpg><p>This isn't the first attempt at producing a series about Clarice Starling, believe it or not. Back in 2012, the Lifetime Network was actually working on getting a Clarice related show together, but after several months of pre-production, the project was put on the back burner as&nbsp;Hannibal&nbsp;aired on NBC.</p><h2 id=the-creators-might-delve-into-the-details-of-clarice-s-past><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Creators Might Delve Into The Details Of Clarice's Past</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Clarice-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The creators have confirmed that several details of Clarice's past will be touched upon&nbsp;over the course of the series. Details that appear in the novel, but not in the film, might come into play to give the character a little more depth and a vaster storyline befitting a series.</p><h2 id=loyal-hannibal-fans-are-not-happy-about-the-new-series><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Loyal Hannibal Fans Are Not Happy About The New Series</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Hannibal.jpg><p>The Silence of The Lambs spinoff series Hannibal ran for three seasons on the NBC Network, from 2013 until 2015. Starring Mads Mikkelsen as Hannibal Lecter, the show was abruptly cancelled after the third season, leaving faithful fans gutted. With so much time having past since the season 3 finale, it seems unlikely&nbsp;Hannibal&nbsp;fans will see a continuation anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-series-has-a-5-year-deal-with-cbs><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Series Has A 5-Year Deal With CBS</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CBS-All-Access.jpg><p>CBS was very quick to issue a 5-year deal for the production of Clarice, and it's looking like the series will air for several seasons beyond that should CBS' confidence pay off. With fantastic writers and producers on board, the project has the potential to be a big hit with viewers.</p><h2 id=it-s-the-first-time-in-twenty-years-that-clarice-starling-will-appear><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>It's The First Time In Twenty Years That Clarice Starling Will&nbsp;Appear</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Clarice-Starling.jpg><p>After a two-decade hiatus, Clarice Starling's character will finally get to be in the spotlight again. While Hannibal Lecter might've been seen as the main&nbsp;focus&nbsp;of the film, the&nbsp;spotlight will&nbsp;center&nbsp;on the life and experiences of the FBI agent who worked on the shocking and mysterious case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-creators-have-worked-together-before-on-star-trek><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Creators Have Worked Together Before On Star Trek&nbsp;</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Star-Trek-Discovery.jpg><p>Alex Kurtzman and Jenny Lumet are real life friends, and have worked together on several projects before. They most famously have worked together on several of the more recent&nbsp;Star Trek franchise films, and most recently they both wrote and produced The Mummy, released in 2017, as a pair.</p><h2 id=some-of-the-script-will-be-based-on-the-1988-book-silence-of-the-lambs-by-thomas-harris><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Some Of The Script Will Be Based On The 1988 Book, 'Silence Of The Lambs' By Thomas Harris</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Silence-Of-The-Lambs-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though the original film stayed quite loyal to the book that it was based on, many of&nbsp;its details were omitted, and the screenplay was adapted to be more coherent as a film. The television series promises to touch on some parts of the book that were never told on the screen.</p><h2 id=the-show-will-be-filmed-in-washington-d-c><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Show Will Be Filmed In Washington, D.C.</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Washington-DC.jpg><p>Clarice Starling is an FBI agent who lives in Washington, D.C., and the series will continue to take place in her hometown. Filming is scheduled to commence in the coming months in the city where we first came to know Hannibal Lecter. It's safe to say Washington, D.C. will be a regular setting.</p><h2 id=neither-jodie-foster-nor-julianne-moore-will-play-clarice><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Neither Jodie Foster Nor Julianne Moore Will Play Clarice</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Jodie-Foster-Julianne-Moore.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress who will portray Clarice in the new television adaptation is not yet named, but we know for sure that both Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore are not playing the lead role. Both in their late 50's, they just wouldn't be the right fit to play a young Clarice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoqSVo7Cmec6fZK2glWK5ornBrGScmqNiwKa%2ByJ6qZq%2BYlsFuw8Rmoqenp2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./are-beyonc%C3%A9-and-gwyneth-paltrow-still-friends-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Beyonc And Gwyneth Paltrow Still Friends Today?">&larr;
