When you have that kind of money, it is only logical that you enjoy spending some of it on things that other people could only dream of buying. For example, the couple owns a private jet, a private island, an $88 million mansion, and all kinds of other expensive and exclusive stuff. They also love to spend money on their kids, meaning those three little munchkins own a few pretty impressive and super-expensive toys and clothing items, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyonce and Jay-Z got married in 2008 and they welcomed their first child, their daughter Blue Ivy, on January 7, 2012. Blue Ivy was an only child for over 5 years but she became a big sister on June 13, 2017, when the twins, Rumi and Sir Carter, were born. Over the years, we have seen a number of amazing gifts that Blue Ivy&nbsp;has received from her parents,&nbsp;so there is definitely a reason to believe that things won’t be much different for the twins. Let’s take a look at 15 most expensive things Beyonce has gotten for her three kids.</p><h2 id=80-000-diamond-encrusted-barbie>$80,000 Diamond-Encrusted Barbie</h2><p>Blue Ivy’s 1st birthday party was anything but ordinary and it cost Queen Bey and her hubby nearly $200,000. The couple spent&nbsp;around $95,000 on flowers and decorations, $30,000 on toys, jewelry, and costumes for the guests, and$2,400 on the birthday cake. However, the most impressive thing Blue Ivy got that day was a diamond-encrusted Barbie doll that is worth $80,000! According to the Carters, they wanted Blue’s 1st birthday to set the tone for the rest of her life and they definitely spared no expense that day to do so. On the other hand, when your parents are the most powerful couple in music, you can probably expect a bit more than just a few balloons and a simple chocolate cake from the box for your birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=600-000-rocking-horse>$600,000 Rocking Horse</h2><p>When their first baby was born, Beyonce and Jay-Z spared no expense, wanting to make sure that little Blue Ivy will grow up in the lap of luxury. Her birth was a huge moment for them for more than one reason. Not only is she their first-born baby but she was also their&nbsp;miracle baby after Beyonce’s miscarriage in 2010 which was, without a doubt, one of the saddest things the couple had ever endured. Once they welcomed Blue Ivy into the world, Bey and Jay-Z decided to shower her with expensive and unique gifts. The most impressive one being the solid-gold, handmade rocking horse worth over $600,000! This amazing toy was designed and made by Japanese jeweler Ginza Tanaka, a famous manufacturer of precious metals materials.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-000-high-chair>$15,000 High Chair</h2><p>Every toddler needs a high chair to enjoy their tasty baby food but not all kids have had the pleasure to eat their strained peas in a high chair worth $15,000! But when you are a child of Queen Bey, that is not such an unusual thing. Beyonce spent $15,000 on a high chair designed by Carla Monchen,&nbsp;which was covered in Swarovski crystals. They must have been really happy with it because they bought another one worth $12,000 and gifted it to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a> so their daughter could dine in style as well! So while the parents are enjoying their meals in some of the most expensive restaurants around the world, their kids are having their own kind luxurious meals in those unique and super-expensive high chairs.</p><h2 id=2-5-million-pacifiers>$2.5 million Pacifiers</h2><p>Pacifiers are one of the most commonly used things in the world&nbsp;for new babies. You can buy them in almost every drugstore and they cost around $5. However, Beyonce and Jay-Z weren’t all that happy with those regular plastic binkies and decided to take a more extravagant approach. Rumor has it that they spent $2.5 million on bejeweled pacifiers designed by Suommo. However, that wasn’t all! In case their baby twins get tired of their luxurious binkies, they have a couple of spare 3-carat diamond pacifiers in 18-carat white gold that cost around $17,000 a piece. If the twins get fussy now and then, they will suck on a couple of pacifiers that cost more than most people’s house. Not a bad way to pacify a child…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=26-000-gown-for-blue-ivy>$26,000 Gown For Blue Ivy</h2><p>When Beyonce and Jay-Z took their daughter to the Beauty and the Beast premiere, people were pretty surprised to learn that the silk-chiffon Gucci gown Blue Ivy was wearing is worth $26,000! All three of them decided to wear Gucci that night. Jay-Z chose a tiger-and-floral embroidered Gucci denim jacket, Bey (who was pregnant with the twins at the time) was wearing a gorgeous green Gucci gown but little Blue Ivy was definitely the best dressed one. She was wearing the children's version of a dress that costs $26,000. However, that is not the only impressive clothing piece in Blue’s closet. She was spotted wearing a $1,700 Gucci ensemble when she&nbsp;attended an NBA All-Star Game, she and her mom wore a matching set of Dolce & Gabbana gowns on Mother’s Day, and she was photographed in a $10,950 Mischka Aoki dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=20-000-fantasy-carriage-crib>$20,000 Fantasy Carriage Crib</h2><p>The Fantasy Carriage Crib is a perfect crib for all of the little princesses out there that wish to turn their nursery into a fairytale land. However, if you want your daughter to sleep in a crib like this one, you will have to spend nearly $20,000 because those things aren’t cheap at all! Luckily for Blue Ivy, her parents are able to afford gorgeous furniture such as this carriage-shaped crib by Posh Tots. It is constructed with a solid cedar frame, a leather seat, and a rear box designed as a changing table. However, the most impressive thing about this unusual crib is the shape, which makes it look like Cinderella’s carriage. On the other hand, no matter how cute it is, most parents wouldn’t even think about spending this much money on a crib.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-000-evian-water-bath>$6,000 Evian Water Bath</h2><p>Queen Bey stayed with her daughter Blue Ivy in a Miami hotel on the New Year’s Eve in 2014. She treated her daughter to a luxurious Evian water bath, which cost $6,000 for both of them. If you haven’t heard of Evian water, it is one of the most expensive bottled mineral waters you can buy. It is imported from France where it’s bottled from only one particular source that is known for being very rich in various minerals. Also, its balanced mineral composition and low sodium content make it perfect for babies and mothers. While some mothers would choose to simply drink it from time to time, Beyonce decided to have a luxurious Evian water mother-daughter bath. It was definitely good for both of them but is a bath truly worth paying $6,000 for? Well, who are we to decide?</p><h2 id=blue-ivy-s-toy-car-collection>Blue Ivy’s Toy Car Collection</h2><p>Even though Blue Ivy is years away from getting her driver’s license, she already owns a couple of cars that are way cooler than some of the real cars out there. She has a personalized blue Ferrari with the words "Blue Ivy Baby Slab" written on the front and the words "BABY SLAB" on the seats inside. Even more impressive than this cool Ferrari is her pink Cadillac Escalade, which is twice the size of her blue sports car. It has some gold detailing and girly pink seats,&nbsp;making it the perfect car for little princesses like Blue Ivy. If these cars came in an adult size, there are definitely some girls out there who would enjoy them&nbsp;because these toy cars are as cool as they come!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=106-000-gold-cribs-for-the-twins>$106,000 Gold Cribs For The Twins</h2><p>If you thought that the Carters spent too much money on Blue Ivy’s crib, just wait until you hear how much the twins’ cribs cost. For the records, the crib Blue Ivy spent her toddler days in was designed by Posh Tots, shaped like a princess’ carriage, and cost nearly $20,000. However, while Blue’s crib was made of wood, Beyonce and Jay-Z decided to go for a much more expensive material when choosing the matching cribs for the twins, opting for two solid-gold ones worth $106,000. Each crib is custom-made and plated in 18-carat gold. It has a hypoallergenic mattress, silk bedding and changing mat, etc. There are also little wheels at the bottom of these luxurious cribs so Bey can roll her sleeping babies around if she needs to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-that-bling>All That Bling</h2><p>Beyonce’s bling at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards was a much-discussed subject and there is no denying that both her and her mini-me, Blue Ivy, looked beautiful that night. Blue’s outfit was breathtakingly&nbsp;glamorous and it was worth A LOT! She was wearing an $11,000 rose tulle gown and (as if that wasn’t impressive enough) she also had a sparkling Lorraine Schwartz tiara on the top of her head. Meanwhile, Beyonce broke a lot of records with her own bling that night as she wore around $13 million worth of diamonds. Well, like mother like daughter. It appears that Blue Ivy has inherited her mother's taste in expensive clothes and jewelry. There aren’t too many children who can brag about wearing real diamonds but Blue owns more than she can count, including her diamond studs, diamond tiara etc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blue-ivy-got-the-louvre-all-to-herself>Blue Ivy Got The Louvre All To Herself</h2><p>One of the most famous museums in the world, the Louvre in Paris, gets over a million visitors every year but there was one day when the museum had only one visitor – Blue Ivy. Apparently, Beyonce and Jay-Z wanted their daughter to get the best possible experience from the museum without having to be surrounded by hundreds of tourists, so they paid the museum to close&nbsp;their doors&nbsp;to all everyone else except for them that day. She got a private tour with the whole museum all to herself. We don’t know how much this day of culture had cost the Carter family but it must have been A LOT of money! It is the Louvre, after all! Of course, Blue Ivy didn’t just travel to Paris like any other child... she got there in her family’s private jet!</p><h2 id=1-million-nursery-at-barclays-center>$1 Million Nursery At Barclays Center</h2><p>Not only does Blue Ivy have a million dollar nursery in her own home, she has another one at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. So while her mom and dad are there watching the games, little Blue Ivy can chill in her private luxurious nursery suite worth a whopping $1 million! All of her toys are always there waiting for her so she&nbsp;won't miss her home&nbsp;or her own room too much.&nbsp;Blue Ivy does not just play with any toys, either. Rumor has it that she has a couple hundred thousand dollar worth of toys delivered anywhere she travels so there is no way she gets bored when she spends the night at a new place. Who knows if the twins will also get their own nursery at the Barclays Center or if Blue will have to share…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blue-ivy-carter-products>Blue Ivy Carter Products</h2><p>Blue Ivy Carter didn’t even start school before becoming a tiny, little businesswoman. Beyonce’s company is planning to launch a line of products called “Blue Ivy Carter” and it will cover everything from the entertainment services such as movie production, live musical performances, and fan club, to&nbsp;a line of beauty products, fragrances, hair care products, etc. Rumor has it&nbsp;that the brand will target the children's market, which makes sense when you think about it. So instead of buying super expensive toys and clothes, Beyonce decided to take things one step further and buy her eldest daughter a whole business. Getting your own cosmetic line must be one of the most awesome and expensive gifts in the world. Blue will definitely appreciate it a lot more once she is a little bit older.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=personal-chef-stylist-and-more>Personal Chef, Stylist, And More</h2><p>The Knowles-Carter kids don’t spend their days like most other children in the world. Their parents have spent a lot of money on all kinds of services to make sure their kids will always have the best care possible. Blue Ivy has her own personal stylist and, since she is a picky eater, has her own chef who is there to cook everything the little princess craves. There are also four full-time nannies in the Carter household; two for the twins and two for Blue. One of Blue’s nannies teaches her art, French, and even Swahili. Let’s not even get into the unbelievably extravagant birthday parties that the Carters love to throw for their kids. Since they spent $200,000 on Blue Ivy’s 1st birthday party, we can only wait and see what will the twins' 1st birthday look like but we shall all expect something pretty spectacular this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=500-000-nursery-for-the-twins>$500,000 Nursery For The Twins</h2><p>Before the birth of their twins Rumi and Sir, Beyonce and Jay-Z wanted to make sure that they would have everything they could possibly need (and more), so they spent around $500,000 on a lavish nursery. They got rid of a wall separating two bedrooms in their new mansion to create a master suite-size nursery. Rumi and Sir have matching rockers and cribs with $30,000 designer sheets. There is also a $20,000 mural on the ceiling with the glowing stars and the planets, as well as a $50,000 sound system installed in the room. The twins have their own walk-in closets, a fireplace, and a home-theatre in their nursery. There is no doubt their friends will visit them quite often because who wouldn’t want to play and spend time in a room like this?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGR%2BdnnUm5yrZZWtvaa60qKtnmWknbavs9JmmZ6xn6OwpnnAp5tmopGuert5waisoKCkYrOwvoytn56homK4qrDSaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ariana-grande-s-wedding-band-reportedly-designed-by-husband-dalton-gomez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ariana Grande's Wedding Band Reportedly Designed By Husband Dalton Gomez">&larr;
