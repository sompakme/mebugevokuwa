Although most people are unlikely to meet theirs, there is a surprisingly large number of lookalikes in the world of celebrities, Hollywood, and the music industry. Most of the time lookalikes or doppelgängers are usually related or family members. Even in the world of celebrities most actors and actresses only have to contend with looking similar to their brother or sister. Thor actor Chris Hemsworth, for example, is often confused with his actor brothers Liam and Luke Hemsworth. The Baldwin brothers are another example of this. Or even <i>Avengers </i>actress Elizabeth Olsen and her older twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While meeting our lookalike and getting confused for someone else would be quite fun in most normal walks of life, for some celebrities it can become quite tiresome if they are getting confused with other stars working in the same field.</p><p>However, other actresses on this list are certainly more flattered about comparisons to their peers than others and have a lot of fun with it at fans' and even journalists' expense. Take a look at some of the most uncanny doppelgängers in the entertainment industry.</p><h2 id=jaime-pressly-and-margot-robbie>Jaime Pressly and Margot Robbie</h2><p>Award-winning television and movie actresses Margot Robbie and Jaime Pressly are a pair who some movie going fans thought were the same person for quite some time. This was especially true when Margot’s fame was rising with her stand out roles in <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>, <i>The Legend of Tarzan,</i> and of course <i>Suicide Squad</i> when she played Harley Quinn. Robbie’s most recent role as Tonya Harding in <i>I, Tonya</i> earned her Academy Award and BAFTA nominations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>According to <a href=#>Mashable</a>, Robbie is set to reprise the Harley Quinn role with a planned <i>Birds of Prey</i> movie also set in the DC Universe, which will also focus on the Batgirl character.</strong></p><p>Filming for the new DC film will begin as soon as Robbie is finished on Quentin Tarantino's <i>Once Upon a Time Hollywood</i>. The film will feature other core female members of DC such as Huntress, Black Canary, and possibly Catwoman. Jaime Pressly rose to fame with roles in <i>DOA: Dead or Alive, Ringmaster, Not Another Teen Movie</i>, and<i> I Love You, Man</i>. Pressly is probably better known to fans for her roles as Joy Turner in the NBC sitcom <i>My Name is Earl </i>and the CBS comedy<i> Mom </i>as Jill Kendall.</p><h2 id=lucy-hale-and-selena-gomez>Lucy Hale and Selena Gomez</h2><p>Lucy Hale and Selena Gomez don’t just look alike; they also have career talents in common. Both are actresses and singers that had an early start in Disney Channel shows such <i>Wizards of Waverly Place</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Lucy Hale has focused mostly on her career as an actress with her prominent role in <i>Pretty Little Liars</i>. However, she admits that music will always be her first love and even released her first album <i>Road Between</i> in 2014 under the label DMG Nashville.</strong></p><p>Hale’s acting career continues to flourish, though, with a lead role on the CW comedy-drama series <i>Life Sentence</i> as Stella Abbott, a young woman&nbsp;who has to deal with the aftermath of having her cancer cured and the choices she made because she thought she was dying. She is also set to appear as a lead character in three films in 2018 called <i>The Unicorn</i>, <i>Truth or Dare</i> and <i>Dude</i>.</p><p>Selena Gomez, while making several notable acting appearances in films like <i>Spring Breakers, Hotel Transylvania,</i> and <i>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising,</i>&nbsp;is perhaps better known for her pop career. In addition, Gomez also served as the executive producer on the hit Netflix series 13 Reasons Why in 2017 with a second season to follow in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carmen-electra-and-lauren-conrad>Carmen Electra and Lauren Conrad</h2><p>Carmen Electra and Lauren Conrad are both television personalities, models, and fashion designers. Electra got her start with acting roles in TV shows like <i>Baywatch, Baywatch Nights</i>, and films like <i>American Vampire, Starstruck</i>, and <i>Good Burger.</i> Conrad, however, made her television debut with roles on reality shows like <i>The Hills </i>and <i>Laguna Beach </i>before moving on to real acting roles in <i>Privileged, Greek,</i> and <i>Family Guy.</i></p><p>Electra’s TV career since the Baywatch series has taken off with notable appearances in her own reality series <i>Carmen and Dave: An MTV Love Story </i>and as the host on several shows such as <i>Singled Out, Battlebots, Dance Fever</i>, and <i>Manhunt: The Search for America’s Most Gorgeous Male Model. </i>In addition, Electra has appeared as herself on <i>The Simpsons, House M.D., </i>the <i>Friends</i> spinoff <i>Joey</i>, and <i>Jane the Virgin.</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Taking a look at both Electra and Conrad you would be forgiven if you were to confuse the two TV personalities especially when their career paths have taken a very similar route.</strong></p><p>Both stars have made a success in presenting and using their public image to support and work for charity organizations focusing on marriage equality, children’s charities, and debilitating illnesses.</p><h2 id=margot-kidder-and-courtney-cox>Margot Kidder and Courtney Cox</h2><p>While actresses like Amy Adams, Erica Durance, and Teri Hatcher have given great performances as Lois Lane throughout the many versions Superman, for many, Margot Kidder is the ultimate Lois in very much the same way that Christopher Reeve is ultimate Clark Kent/Superman.</p><p><strong>During the 1990s when there were talks of bringing the Superman franchise back to life with new actors in the roles of Lois and Clark many fans were hoping that Friends actress Courtney Cox would take over the role.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s hard to deny that she would have been a perfect fit because not only has she proved she can play a strong, likeable and feisty leads with Monica, but she bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Margot Kidder. While both actresses aren’t in the public eye as much as they used to at the peak of their careers, they are still active in Hollywood. Margot Kidder has appeared in several in Canadian and American productions such as <i>Real Gangsters, No Deposit</i>, and <i>The Neighborhood.&nbsp;</i>Courteney Cox has made appearances in notable films like <i>Scream 4, Just Before I Go</i>, and <i>Mothers and Daughters. </i>Cox has also taken on directing and writing duties with her sitcom <i>Cougar Town.</i></p><h2 id=victoria-justice-and-nina-dobrev>Victoria Justice and Nina Dobrev</h2><p>Two actresses/singers that could easily pass as twins – let alone sisters – are Victoria Justice and Nina Dobrev. The two have long been compared and fans apparently flipped out when they posed for a photograph together at the Teen Choice Awards in 2015 according to <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a> and are totally aware that they are considered doppelgängers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After launching a successful singing career Justice is now pursuing more acting roles with several film and TV projects such as <i>The Outcasts</i>, <i>Robot Chicken, </i>and<i> Man with a Plan</i>. Dobrev’s acting career has gone from strength to strength after her iconic role as Elena in The Vampire Diaries. She has managed to land herself leading roles in Hollywood blockbusters like <i>xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Flatliners,&nbsp;</i>and <i>Dog Days.</i></p><p>Victoria Justice was recently seen portraying Janet Weiss in <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let’s Do The Time Warp Again,&nbsp;</i>a tribute show that aired on Fox using the original script from Richard O’Brien and Jim Sharman. Fans of Tru TV’s <i>Impractical Jokers</i> would have noticed her guest appearance on their spin-off show <i>Impractical Jokers: After Party</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dobrev's next television project is swapping the supernatural and vampire setting for the upcoming CW comedy series called <i>Fam,&nbsp;</i>which centralizes on Dobrev's character called Clem and her younger half-sister played by <i>Nashville’s </i>Odessa Adlon.</p><h2 id=helen-hunt-and-leelee-sobieski>Helen Hunt and Leelee Sobieski</h2><p>Leelee Sobieski had many leading roles in several hit movies from the 90s with Jungle 2 Jungle, Deep Impact, Never Been Kissed, and Eyes Wide Shut. It was during this time that many film fans thought that she may have been related to Helen Hunt whose career also peaked in the 1990s with hits like <i>Twister, Mad About You</i>, and <i>As Good as it Gets.</i></p><p><strong>Hunt’s performance in<i> As Good as it Gets</i> earned her an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a Screen Actors award for best actress.</strong></p><p>Her most recent roles on film and TV have gained more her critical acclaim with roles in <i>I Love You Daddy, Bobby, Ride, The Miracle Season</i>, and the ten-part Fox drama <i>Shots Fired </i>in 2017. In addition, Hunt is set to reprise her role as Jamie Stemple Buchman in Mad About You a sitcom that ran from 1992 to 1999.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nowadays, Hunt<i> co-</i>owns her own production company under Sony Pictures Entertainment called Hunt/Tavel Productions alongside Connie Tavel. Sobieski, however, chooses to pick smaller independent roles in film and television preferring to focus on her children instead. Her most recent role was as a stalker in the 2016 film <i>The Last Film Festival</i>.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-and-claudia-alende>Megan Fox and Claudia Alende</h2><p>Megan Fox became a megastar in the 2000s with her breakout role in the Transformers film franchise as Mikaela Banes. Fox eventually moved on to the other successful live-action reboot of a toy line with the <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> franchise.</p><p><strong>Even though it can be argued that Fox has been typecast in blockbuster films it’s hard to deny that she is instantly recognizable. So when Brazilian model Claudia Allende gained media attention after winning a Brazilian beauty contest she became an instant hit on Instagram because of her uncanny resemblance to the Hollywood actress.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More than just a pretty face, Alende started her own business from a young age and now has her own clothing line that is doing well in her home country. In addition, she now has over 10 million followers on Instagram and has now released a pop single called “I’m Good at Being Bad.”</p><p>Megan Fox has been tipped to reprise the role of April O’Neil for the next T<i>eenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> movie and is set to star in a family comedy Think Like a Dog alongside her former <i>Transformers</i> co-star Josh Duhamel.</p><h2 id=eva-mendes-and-ashley-graham>Eva Mendes and Ashley Graham</h2><p>Model Ashley Graham gained fame after appearing as one of the first plus-size models to feature on the cover of <i>Sports Illustrated. </i>In addition, she featured in Levi advertising campaigns and fashion magazines such as <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Elle</i>.</p><p><strong>Graham who is recognizable in her own right has been compared to Hollywood actress Eva Mendes. Despite taking time away from the big screen to focus on motherhood Mendes is still one of the most recognizable stars on film.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has appeared in the <i>Fast and Furious</i> franchise, <i>Knocked Up, The Other Guys</i>, and <i>Hitch</i>. In addition to parenthood, Mendes is working as the creative director of the makeup line CIRCA Beauty.&nbsp;Ashley Graham’s modeling career has now transitioned into television roles with an appearance on MTV’s <i>Made</i> as a coach to aspiring models. She also served as the backstage host for the 2016 and 2017 Miss USA and Miss Universe competitions. Additionally, Graham is a judge on VH1’s <i>America’s Next Top Model.</i></p><p>As an advocate for body positivity, the model, and TV host has also released her memoir providing some insight into her career called<i> A New Model: What Confidence, Beauty, and Power Really Look Like.</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daisy-ridley-and-keira-knightley>Daisy Ridley and Keira Knightley</h2><p>British actresses Keira Knightley and Daisy Ridley not only share an uncanny resemblance to each other but both got their big breaks in a Star Wars film. While Ridley’s role as Rey was far more prominent Knightley played the supporting role of Sabe the handmaiden and decoy for Padme Amidala in <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.&nbsp;</i>Knightley gained international fame after starring in the <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> film franchise and has become an award-winning Hollywood star. Ridley’s star is also rising, because in addition to the Star Wars series she has starred in <i>Murder on the Orient Express, </i>Peter Rabbit, and has other films in production. Yet despite their similar looks and background, the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> revealed that Daisy isn’t fond of the comparisons:</p><p><strong>"This is one thing that I’m actually so 'ugh!' about. But it’s like, why do I have to be like someone else?" says the 23-year-old.&nbsp;"People have always said that I look like Keira Knightley. But it is actually really frustrating."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the eventual release of the third and final part of the new <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy, Ridley has already suggested that she won’t return to reprise the role of Rey in any more Star Wars films in the future.</p><h2 id=natalie-portman-and-kate-bosworth>Natalie Portman and Kate Bosworth</h2><p>Fans have always noticed a resemblance between Natalie Portman and Keira Knightley, especially after the two actresses essentially played doubles in<i> Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. </i>However, a few have noticed a similarity between <i>Superman Returns </i>actress Kate Bosworth and Portman.</p><p>Both actresses have appeared together at fashion shows together such as the Marc Jacobs Spring show in 2005 and aside from the differences in hair color, it’s hard to deny the resemblance between the two. It was perhaps more noticeable when Bosworth went brunette to play Lois Lane showing that she shares many similar features with Natalie Portman.</p><p>Most recently, Kate Bosworth has been busy with both TV roles with the British spy drama <i>SS-GB</i>, and <i>The Long Road Home</i> and on film with the Netflix movie <i>Before I Wake</i>, crime thriller <i>Heist </i>alongside Robert DeNiro, and the upcoming movie<i> The Domestics.</i></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Natalie Portman has also been busy with her most recent roles in the well-received science fiction horror <i>Annihilation, </i><i>Jane Got a Gun</i> and <i>Song to Song</i>. In addition to her film work, she has launched her own vegan footwear and is committed to promoting animal rights and welfare movements around the world.</p><h2 id=sarah-hyland-and-mila-kunis>Sarah Hyland and Mila Kunis</h2><p>Sarah Hyland has been acting since she was a child with roles in Howard Stern’s biopic <i>Private Parts </i>and <i>The Audrey Hepburn Story</i>. However, it was her breakthrough role as Hayley Dunphy in ABC’s family sitcom <i>Modern Family</i>. It was then that fans of the show quickly noticed how much she looked like <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall </i>and<i> Black Swan </i>actress Mila Kunis.</p><p>Since <i>Modern Family</i>, Hyland has appeared in the <i>Dirty Dancing</i> TV remake as Lisa Houseman and as Seelie Queen in the <i>Shadowhunters</i> TV series. In addition, she has performed as a voice acting artist portraying Tifu in The Lion King based cartoon series <i>The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar</i> and <i>The Lion Guard: The Rise of Scar</i>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with <a href=#>InStyle</a> Hyland admitted that she often gets called Mila by fans on a regular basis and apparently Mila often experiences the same mix-up. She confessed that both herself and Mila often pretend to just go along with it when journalists and fans mix them up at red carpet events.</p><p>Mila’s most recent films have been the <i>Bad Moms</i> comedy film franchises with the most recent being <i>A Bad Moms Christmas </i>which performed well at the box office despite mixed reviews.</p><h2 id=sienna-miller-and-mollie-king>Sienna Miller and Mollie King</h2><p>Since English-American actress Sienna Miller’s breakout roles in the British films <i>Layer Cake</i> alongside future James Bond Daniel Craig and <i>Alfie </i>with Jude Law, her career in Hollywood has since flourished with big roles in<i> </i><i>Stardust, Interview, G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra</i>, and <i>American Sniper. </i>Miller is instantly recognizable and has modeled for the Pirelli Calendar, Italian Vogue, and modeled for Pepe Jeans in their advertising campaigns.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With her Boho-chic style, Miller is very distinctive looking, that is until fans noticed how much Mollie King the former member of the British girl group known as the Saturdays looks like her. King was a member of the band until they parted ways in 2014.</p><p>The former girl band member still releases music as a solo artist but has since become a radio presenter for BBC Radio 1 and has appeared as a guest presenter for children’s TV show <i>Blue Peter. </i>In addition, King was a contestant on the BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing in 2017 reaching the semi-finals.</p><p>With Mollie King’s transition to more active television roles which include a guest appearance on the British soap <i>Hollyoaks </i>maybe. Now that both ladies have some acting experience who knows, maybe Miller and King will get cast as sisters because they could easily pull it off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-cooke-and-leighton-meester>Olivia Cooke and Leighton Meester</h2><p>Leighton Meester and Olivia Cooke are both successful young actresses whose stars are continuing to rise in Hollywood and they look uncannily similar. Cooke is more focused on her film career and Meester is seen mostly on television shows.</p><p>Olivia Cooke is a British actress that is perhaps best known for her role in Steven Spielberg’s <i>Ready Player One</i>. Although she has had several notable movie appearances prior to this with films like <i>The Signal, Ouija</i>, and <i>The Quiet Ones.</i> In addition to a possible follow up to the hugely successful <i>Ready Player One C</i>ooke’s next major film is <i>Life Itself </i>starring alongside Oscar Isaac, Olivia Wilde, Samuel L. Jackson, and Antonio Banderas.</p><p>Meester is perhaps best known for playing Blair Waldorf in the American teen drama series <i>Gossip Girl </i>from 2007 to 2012. More recently, she has appeared in the Fox comedy series <i>Making History</i> as Deborah Revere. In addition to her well-known TV roles, Meester has been seen films such as That’s My Boy with Adam Sandler, The Oranges with Adam Brody and Hugh Laurie and <i>The Roommate </i>which despite receiving negative reviews earned her praise for her performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=portia-de-rossi-and-drea-de-matteo>Portia de Rossi and Drea de Matteo</h2><p>Born just a year apart actresses Drea de Matteo and Portia de Rossi could be mistaken for twins. Yet despite the similarities in their names and looks the women aren’t related. In fact, neither one of these ladies is even born in the same country. <i>The Sopranos</i> actress de Matteo famous for playing Adriana was born in New York in the US and de Rossi who is perhaps best known for playing Lindsay Bluth Funke on <i>Arrested Development</i> was born Geelong, Australia.</p><p>Portia de Rossi has been busy with other notable TV roles with her most recent role as Elizabeth North in the political thriller<i> Scandal </i>from season 4 in 2014 until 2017.

Torv finds comparisons very flattering and in an interview with <a href=#>Star2</a> Torv stated that she was compared to the actress back in her student days: "Yeah, we both went to NIDA. She was quite a few years before me. But I remember I was 17 and had just moved to Sydney, and they were doing a production of The Seagull. Cate was playing the lead, but no one knew who she was at that point. When we came out, someone said, 'You remind me of that girl in that play.' So that’s been happening for a really long time and, of course, I’m immensely flattered."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Torv is busy these days filming the second season for true crime thriller <i>Mindhunter</i> which was based on the book of the same name.
