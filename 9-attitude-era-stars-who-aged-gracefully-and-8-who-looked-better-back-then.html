The rivalry between WCW and WWE was going strong, wrestlers like Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, and Triple H were running great in WWE, while the nWo, was taking over WCW. It’s why ratings were high and wrestling was part of the mainstream. It seems like such a long time ago, but it was only 20 years ago, and it would surprise some people that some of the wrestlers from the Attitude Era are still working in the business today, for better or for worse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few of them, however, have aged pretty well and could still go in the ring today if they wanted, while others are definitely showing their age and the wear and tear on their body after years of being in the ring. Here is a look at some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Attitude Era</a> icons who have aged gracefully over the years, and others who definitely looked better back then.</p><h2 id=aged-gracefully-edge><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Edge</span></h2><p>The Rated R Superstar Edge was jumping off ladders and hitting people with chairs during the Attitude Era in the infamous TLC matches. Today, he has aged pretty well, considering the damage he has done to his body and neck. Probably stepping away from wrestling early helped him age gracefully.</p><h2 id=looked-better-the-undertaker><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Looked Better: The Undertaker</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Undertaker </a>was well before the Attitude Era and still wrestling today and it shows, as years of taking bumps have left him weathered. Every year at WrestleMania he makes a return and like clockwork, seems to go right back to the hospital because of the bumps he takes. That’s also a lot of jet black hair dye to get his hair back to his in-ring look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aged-gracefully-christian><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Christian</span></h2><p>Christian was also going through tables and taking plenty of chair and ladder shots early in his career during the attitude era, but today he looks pretty good for someone in his 40s. Like his partner Edge, Christian had to leave wrestling early which probably helped him age a lot better than guys who are still taking bumps.</p><h2 id=looked-better-val-venis><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Looked Better: Val Venis</span></h2><p>It’s hard to think that this man used to be an adult film star in the WWE, and one of the best physiques in the company. Val Venis had all women looking at him when he removed his towel in the ring, but age has caught up to the Big Valbowski, and today, he probably isn’t getting those same lady screams he once did.</p><h2 id=aged-gracefully-matt-hardy><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Matt Hardy</span></h2><p>For a guy who is still in the business, Matt Hardy looks pretty good for his age. The white streak in his hair during his Broken Matt hardy is a dye job, but he still looks like the same Matt Hardy taking bumps off the top of the ladders. That’s why he remains in the WWE, 20 years after the Attitude Era.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=looked-better-shane-mcmahon><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Looked Better: Shane McMahon</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shane McMahon</a> was a huge hit during the Attitude Era and took plenty of massive dives and bumps. He was younger than, and when he returned to the WWE, he looked a lot older than the boy wonder we all knew from the Attitude Era. That’s a lot of grey hair for the best in the world.</p><h2 id=aged-gracefully-al-snow><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Al Snow</span></h2><p>Al Snow has a little grey around the beard, but the iconic holder of ‘head’ in WWE looks better today than he did during his run. He has added a lot of muscle and is in the best shape of his life. It’s almost too bad he didn’t have this look during his run, because his charisma easily could have got him over with the right look.</p><h2 id=looked-better-shawn-michaels><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Looked Better: Shawn Michaels</span></h2><p>Shawn Michaels was perhaps the biggest name in the Attitude Era before he had to retire the first time because of back issues. He still has the ability to put on matches, like he did at Crown Jewel last year, but Michaels is definitely showing his age, although his shaved head is a better look that a massive receding hairline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aged-gracefully-torrie-wilson><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Torrie Wilson</span></h2><p>WCW’s Attitude Era Diva was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Torrie Wilson</a>, who is a Hall of Famer in WWE now and has aged so well, thanks in large part to continuing to work out and eat healthy. It helps that she’s into a lot of fitness programs and a trainer today. She could still grace the pages of Playboy if she wanted.</p><h2 id=looked-better-bret-hart><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Looked Better: Bret Hart</span></h2><p>Bret Hart has had his fair share of health problems, like a stroke, so we can forgive him a little for not aging as well as he could. The white-haired Hitman was tackled during his Hall of Fame acceptance speech and wasn’t locking in any sharpshooter then. Odd, considering at the start of the Attitude Era, he was the top babyface.</p><h2 id=aged-gracefully-goldust><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Goldust</span></h2><p>Goldust, or Dustin Runnels, looks pretty good for a guy in his 50s who is still in the ring taking bumps and, oh yeah, putting on 5 Star matches with his brother Cody. Runnels has aged pretty well considering how long he has been in the WWE and battles with addiction. He now works out a bunch, which has helped him stay looking young.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=looked-better-chris-jericho><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Looked Better: Chris Jericho</span></h2><p>Chris Jericho may be the best in the world, the greatest of all time, but he hasn’t aged that well. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AEW</a> champion has let himself go from his days during the Attitude Era, and has got a little thick around the waist. Luckily for Jericho, his ability to be a character and evolve have always kept him in the spotlight.</p><h2 id=aged-gracefully-kane><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Kane</span></h2><p>Maybe it helped that Kane spent half his career behind a mask, but today, Kane could pass for just a bit older version of himself. He pretty much hasn’t changed his look and can still put the mask on and look like Attitude Era Kane without much trouble. His body hasn’t fallen apart like some Attitude Era wrestlers.</p><h2 id=looked-better-scott-hall><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Looked Better: Scott Hall</span></h2><p>Scott Hall, or Razor Ramon, left WWE during the Attitude Era, and was a founder of the nWo. But today, he is showing what wear and tear the wrestling business can have on someone, especially with health problems and addictions to drugs. Hall used to be the badest guy in the WWE, but today, he’s lucky to be the badest guy in the old age home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aged-gracefully-trish-stratus><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Trish Stratus</span></h2><p>Trish Stratus is perhaps the finest wine. Is there any question that a list of those who have aged gracefully should include <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trish</a>? She is just as stunning today as she was during the Attitude Era where she worked her way out of the Diva role and into a legit women’s wrestler.</p><h2 id=looked-better-ken-shamrock><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Looked Better: Ken Shamrock</span></h2><p>Ken Shamrock was the most dangerous weapon during his time in WWE during the Attitude Era. The legit MMA fighter, who competed at some of the very first UFC events, still keeps in the ring and octagon, but his age is definitely showing. A lot of bumps and punches have left him weathered, although he still maintains a decent physical appearance at his age.</p><h2 id=aged-gracefully-big-show><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Aged Gracefully: Big Show</span></h2><p>The Big Show actually looks better today than he did during the Attitude Era. He really slimmed down from well over 500 lbs, and today is coming in lighter and even had a hint of a six-pack in one Instagram photo, something he never thought he would get with his body type.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwZpmkqba1wcOeZJ6qkWLAta3RrGSwoJ9irqixw2aeq5mTmrO2uMuyZJqmlGKFbsPHqGSlp5%2BgsqV5wZ6rrZ2iYq%2Bir8pmq6GdnmQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./difference-between-marshall-and-sheriff.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Difference between marshall and sheriff">&larr;
