This comforting mantra might be all that allows you to sleep at night after a spooky viewing experience. But sometimes the horror continues off-screen, becoming more difficult to rationalize.The creators of many horror classics—particularly those involving unholy entities—<a href=#>have been plagued by real life tragedies and paranormal events</a>. Some of these allegedly unnatural events could have simple, non-evil, explanations or have been grossly over-exaggerated. Other supposed horror movie curses have been exposed as mere publicity stunts. However, there are more than a few unsettling behind the scenes stories that have no logical explanation.If you dare to read these unsettling and spoiler-heavy stories, keep scrolling and find out which nine horror movies are rumored to carry real-world curses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=poltergeist-1982><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Poltergeist (1982)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Poltergeist-movie-poster.jpg><p>It is rumored that the curse which befell the fictional Freeling family in Poltergeist similarly <a href=#>attacked the film’s creators</a> after Steven Spielberg used real skeletons as props. While claims of Spielberg’s gruesome cost-cutting tactic are unsubstantiated, it seems to be the only explanation for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the unprecedented death of four cast members</a>. The most untimely deaths were of the actors behind the Freeling daughters. In 1982 Dominique Dunne was murdered in her driveway by her ex-boyfriend. In 1988, Heather O'Rourke passed away during an operation at a children’s hospital due to a previously misdiagnosed congenital intestinal abnormality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rosemary-rsquo-s-baby-1968><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Rosemary’s Baby (1968)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rosemarys-Baby.jpg><p>Rosemary’s Baby is considered “the most cursed hit movie ever made,” according to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Vanity Fair</a>. The film seemed to haunt or corrupt its creators. Some faced serious backlash for their involvement in the film, resulting in mental anguish as well as personal and professional hardship. Others faced tragedy following the film’s release. Director Roman Polanski’s pregnant wife Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family—a night which later inspired Quentin Tarantino’s film,<a href=#> Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>. Both Polanski and producer Robert Evans allegedly committed heinous crimes in their later life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Reasons Why The Fantastic Four Might Actually Be Cursed</a></span></p><h2 id=the-twilight-zone-the-movie-1983><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983)</span></h2><p>An upsetting accidental death behind the scenes of The Twilight Zone: The Movie made viewers wonder if the film carried a dark curse. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The incident</a> occurred while filming a stunt in which a character was supposed to come down in a helicopter to rescue children. Three kids—who were hired illegally—died when the helicopter crashed into them. While many people used a curse to explain the tragic deaths, others blamed it on gross negligence on the part of the film's creators.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-innkeepers-2011><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Innkeepers (2011)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Innkeepers-Movie.jpg><p>Director Ti West stayed at an allegedly haunted inn while filming a movie about that very subject matter. West had heard numerous ghost stories about the Yankee Pedlar Inn when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he began to experience paranormal activity</a>. The Pedlar staff was not surprised when West told them that the lights in his room would randomly flicker, the phone would ring but no one would be there and that he would wake up with the feeling that someone, or something, was in there with him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth Of The Home Alone Cast Curse</a></span></p><h2 id=the-exorcist-1973><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Exorcist (1973)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/THE-EXORCIST-1973.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Exorcist allegedly carried a strong curse </a>that attacked both creators and views. It is reported that a total of nine people in or related to the cast and crew died during production. Also during filming, the MacNeil home set caught on fire and everything but Regan’s room were burned—which remained completely untouched. One of the movie’s actors committed a murder as the film was still being shot, and has been linked to others. Audience members would reportedly pass out while viewing the film, and one sued after breaking their jaw.</p><h2 id=the-amityville-horror-1979-amp-2005><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Amityville Horror (1979 & 2005)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Amityville-Horror.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some say the curse of The Amityville Horror—like the real Amityville haunting— <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is a hoax</a>. The curse rumor began when James Brolin (George Lutz) said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his pants fell off their hanger</a> while he was reading a disturbing part of the script. It was later reported that the cast had been instructed to exaggerate any strange happenings they experienced as a publicity stunt. The alleged curse surrounding the 2005 remake is tougher to explain. Apparently,<a href=#> Ryan Reynolds</a> (George Lutz) kept waking up at 3:15 A.M, just as his character did.</p><h2 id=insidious-2010><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Insidious (2010)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrick-Wilson-Insidious.jpg><p>The supposed curse of Insidious did not manifest through jaw-dropping tragedies, as it did in other productions. However, the cast and crew reported feeling physically sick the moment they entered the set. During filming, a buzzer on an unoccupied floor continuously and inexplicably went off. To this day, no one can explain the strange energy and occurrences on set.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#>The Truth The Curse On The Cast 'The Lost Boys'</a></span></p><h2 id=annabelle-2014><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Annabelle (2014)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Annabelle-Comes-Home.jpg><p>Since Annabelle is based on real accounts from paranormal researchers, the bizarre behind-the-scenes stories are particularly unsettling. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Director John Leonetti told The Hollywood Reporter</a> that he would often see three finger marks drawn through dust—matching Annabelle’s hand. Joseph Bishara’s first time filming in full demon makeup, a light fixture fell directly onto his head. This occurred in the same hallway that the demon was later scripted to kill a janitor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-omen-1976><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Omen (1976)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/the-omen.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Guardian</a>, an executive of The Omen—who identified as a born-again Christian—told the cast and crew to prepare for evil events. The countless bizarre tragedies and near misses that the film’s creators experienced would suggest that Munger’s warning was warranted. On three separate occasions, lighting struck a plane carrying cast and crew members. A producer was also nearly struck by lighting while filming. In one of the most miraculous tragedies, a jet that was supposed to be carrying the lead actor to a shoot hit a flock of birds and crashed directly into a car. Stranger, the car was occupied by the pilot’s family.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Movie & TV Show Productions That Were Famously Cursed</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqKqipL9uuc6voJ6rXafCrrvRnptmrJ9ir6Z5wq6prJ2UZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-steve-harvey-defied-the-odds-and-became-one-of-the-richest-men-on-television.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Steve Harvey Defied The Odds And Became One Of The Richest Men On Television">&larr;
