Back in the 80s, she was a co-owner of a fashion label and boutique stores. The idea for her boutique Koala Blue, short for Korner of Australia L.A., was inspired by her missing being home and the food in Australia during the concert tour for the album Physical. She wanted to create a place where she can find these treats that she missed so much from her native home. Her friend Pat Farrar agreed to form Koala Blue as she was also considering opening a shop before their conversation about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Newton John explained how the idea came together and said, "we went back to Australia last Christmas, and we looked at the clothes and saw designs with kangaroos and koalas and wallabies; it was the perfect timing for us since these things were very different, very novel." The first business opened doors in 1983, located at Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, and included the Australian snacks that she was craving for and missing out on at home. They had aspirations to have 120 stores, but the highest amount they had at one point was 60. All their businesses shut down in 1993 as the recession during that time was too much of a blow for them to recover from. This was not a venture that lasted for decades, but it still served Newton John a way to still experience Australia through fashion and food while being away from home for long periods at a time.</p><h2 id=olivia-newton-john-fund>Olivia Newton John Fund</h2><p>Her personal battles with cancer inspired her to create the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia Newton John Fund</a>, which is a charity that sponsors worldwide research for plant based cancer treatments.

Out of those 35,000, 3000 have been found as effective treatment.
