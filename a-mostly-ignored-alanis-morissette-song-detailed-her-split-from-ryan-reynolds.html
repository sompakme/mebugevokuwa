The two have been together since 2011 and tied the knot in 2012. But before Ryan and Blake became couple goals, Reynolds had two other notable relationships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year he met Blake, <a href=#>Ryan and Scarlett Johansson both filed for divorce</a> from each other after less than two years of marriage. Before that, however, Ryan was in a high-profile relationship that was practically lost to time; he dated Alanis Morissette, and the two were even engaged.</p><p>As songwriters do, Alanis did pen some songs about Ryan Reynolds, and it made headlines at the time. Over the years, many fans (especially Ryan's) have forgotten the unlikely pairing, but Morissette's songs have never gone away.</p><h2 id=how-long-did-alanis-morissette-date-ryan-reynolds>How Long Did Alanis Morissette Date Ryan Reynolds?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ryan-reynolds-and-alanis-morissette-in-2004.jpg><p>The timeline goes that Alanis and Ryan started dating all the way back in 2002, then announced they were engaged in 2004. By 2007, the two went their separate ways, somewhat quietly, at least in terms of celebrity breakups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In total, Alanis and Ryan dated for about five years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Alanis Morissette's Battle With Multiple Crippling Diseases Has Largely Gone Unnoticed By Her Die-Hard Fanbase</a></span></p><p>But looking back, there was more drama than many may have anticipated from Ryan Reynolds. He and Blake are publicly lovey-dovey, of course, but Reynolds seems to keep some details close to his chest in terms of what he shares with fans.</p><p>The two often joke and tease each other, but their dirty laundry (if they have any) isn't aired to the press. Ryan even praises Scarlett Johansson today, <a href=#>showing his ex respect in the media</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, since he dated a singer, that split resulted in some choice lyrics about their breakup. Fortunately for Ryan, most fans seem to have missed that detail in Alanis' past albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alanis-penned-an-entire-breakup-album-about-ryan>Alanis Penned An Entire Breakup Album About Ryan</h2><p>If only Ryan Reynolds knew Taylor Swift back when he dated Alanis Morissette. He could have learned the easier way that singer-songwriters like to write about their experiences, and that includes relationships and breakups.</p><p>Or, he could have looked at her hit track 'You Oughta Know,' <a href=#>which is rumored to be about her ex-boyfriend Dave Coulier</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Despite The Positive Reviews, Alanis Morissette Refused To Attend The Premiere Of Her Documentary, Jagged</a></span></p><p>Alanis' seventh album, Flavors of Entanglement, was said to be written about Ryan Reynolds. In descriptions of the album (namely Wikipedia), Alanis talked about her full journals of ideas and how she was absolutely rich with ideas at the time she was writing (which was around 2006).</p><p>When the album came out in 2008, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alanis spoke more about the album and its inspiration</a>. She talked about how the album was "cathartic" but not necessarily healing, more of a way for her to "see with some clarity whatâ€™s going on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-song-did-alanis-morissette-write-for-ryan-reynolds>What Song Did Alanis Morissette Write For Ryan Reynolds?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/screen-shot-2015-11-10-at-8-48-14-pm.png><p>In an interview with Access, Alanis explained that one specific song was "really about [her] grief" surrounding the split from Ryan; 'Torch' included lyrics that are very clearly about their relationship, including details the public wouldn't have otherwise known.</p><p>Alanis sings, "I miss your smell and your style and your pure abiding way/Miss your approach to life and your body in my bed," and "These are the days of raw despondency/I never dreamed I would have to lay down my torch for you like this."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Guest-Judging On American Idol Transform Alanis Morissette's Net Worth?

After their breakup, though, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morissette spoke about avoiding public romance</a> and keeping her heart safe. In other interviews, she admitted to staying in relationships too long and the breakups being "debilitating."</p><p>She laughed, "Public romance? Iâ€™m going to be avoiding that in the future... I think the only time Iâ€™ll talk about any guy Iâ€™m with will be when Iâ€™m married with six kids."</p><h2 id=alanis-morissette-has-been-married-to-her-husband-since-2010>Alanis Morissette Has Been Married To Her Husband Since 2010</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/did-guest-judging-on-american-idol-transform-alanis-morissette-s-net-worth_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If things weren't tough enough for Alanis when she and Ryan split in February 2007, he began dating Scarlett Johansson very shortly afterward. The two got engaged the following year, married the same year (2008), and were divorced by 2011 (though officially separated in 2010).</p><p>Ryan then met Blake sometime in 2010, and they've been together since.</p><p>Things weren't all bad for Morissette, though; she met her now-husband sometime after their split and got married in 2010. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alanis has three kids with Mario Treadway</a>; a daughter named Onyx, and two sons named Winter and Ever.</p><p>Of her husband, Alanis once wrote on social media, "won the sweepstakes in the daddy department," so she is clearly happy with the husband she wound up with. They may not have six kids (yet), but Morissette kept her relationship under wraps long enough to make sure it was the real deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hopefully, no breakup songs (or entire albums) will come from her marriage to the rapper.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdlrmiusisZKanop7AtLHTrZxmnJGpsm6%2B2JqlZqqVrruwuMOsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./air-car-shark-tank-founder-net-worth-and-investment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Air Car Shark Tank  Founder, Net Worth and Investment">&larr;
