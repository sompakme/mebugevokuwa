The two have been in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship</a> for almost 5 years now and they have certainly come along way since their beginnings. One reason why fans absolutely love Sophie and Joe is that the couple always seemed very authentic, real, and relatable!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="A Timeline Of Gigi Hadid And Zayn Malik's Relationship" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of Gigi Hadid And Zayn Malik's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Today’s list to take a look at their relationship timeline — from Joe sliding into Sophie Turner’s Instagram DMs to them welcoming their daughter Willow into the world.</p><h2 id=in-2016-joe-jonas-slid-into-sophie-turner-s-dms-on-instagram><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>In 2016 Joe Jonas Slid Into Sophie Turner's DMs On Instagram</span></h2><p>We are kicking the list off all the way back in 2016 when the couple got together. Prior to dating each other, the two have been linked to quite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a few other famous celebs</a> — until Joe Jonas made the first move by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sliding into Sophie Turner’s Instagram DM’s</a>.

To the date, Sophie brought plenty of her male friends because she thought that Joe might be a catfish. To her surprise, the two ended up spending the rest of the night chatting away like they knew each other for years — and the rest is pretty much history!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=after-which-the-couple-officially-started-dating><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>After Which The Couple Officially Started Dating</span></h2><p>Soon after their first date, things got a bit more serious between the two stars — and the public quickly caught on.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title="Inside Amy Adams And Christian Bale's Relationship" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Amy Adams And Christian Bale's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Of course, keeping a relationship secret is pretty much impossible in the world of the rich and famous as paparazzi are really good at spotting celebrity couples.

Yes, originally the two didn’t go for a big and glamorous wedding but rather for a very fun and relaxed one.
