She's long been private about her personal life, to the point where fans wondered about her seemingly <a href=#>strange habit of showing off Blue but not her twins</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it turns out Bey has plenty of celebrity pals that she does share with. One of them that was highly publicized in the beginning was with Gwyneth Paltrow.</p><p>Though Beyoncé didn't speak up much about their rumored friendship, Gwyneth spilled the beans about what her pal is really like at home, and gave plenty of details about the time they spent together.</p><p>Yet despite her enthusiasm about being BFFs with Bey, Gwyneth seemingly stopped discussing her famous friend in interviews.</p><p>After a few years of neither of the two stars mentioning the other, fans are wondering <a href=#>what happened to Bey and Gwyneth's friendship</a> over time.</p><p>Are Gwyneth and Beyoncé still friends, or did a falling out drive them — and their families — apart?</p><h2 id=gwyneth-and-beyonce-were-friends-when-blue-was-a-baby>Gwyneth And Beyoncé Were Friends When Blue Was A Baby</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Years ago, when Beyoncé and Jay-Z welcomed their first child, Gwyneth Paltrow was apparently on hand with baby gifts and preschool recommendations.</p><p>In 2018, Romper reported that on a recommendation from Gwyneth Paltrow, Blue Ivy was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attending a private school for Hollywood's elite</a>.</p><p>Though Gwyneth's kids are a bit older than Blue, it's possible she recommended the school because her kids attended as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Gwyneth Paltrow Claims Nepotism Isn't An Unfair Advantage In Hollywood">Gwyneth Paltrow Claims Nepotism Isn't An Unfair Advantage In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Gwyneth also talked about how she had bonded with Beyoncé's kids, and her kids also formed an attachment to Bey and Jay.</p><h2 id=the-martin-and-carter-kids-were-once-friendly>The Martin And Carter Kids Were Once Friendly</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In interviews, Gwyneth has discussed the fact that one of her sons called Jay-Z Uncle Jay, and that she had visited the Carters' home multiple times.</p><p>Daughter Apple admired Beyoncé and wanted to sing like her, and Gwyneth also spent plenty of time with Blue Ivy, she noted in interviews.</p><p>In fact, the families all spent time together, specifically when Gwyneth was still married to Chris Martin; the two couples are rumored to have had double dates at times.</p><p>Jay-Z even rapped a line about Gwyneth and Chris back in 2006.</p><p>That closeness, however, led to some rumors about Bey and Gwyn's relationship — especially once their friendship seemed to temper somewhat, and they both stopped speaking about each other in interviews.</p><h2 id=was-there-a-falling-out-between-bey-and-gwyn>Was There A Falling Out Between Bey and Gwyn?</h2><p>After one misguided joke on a podcast, a rumor began circulating that Gwyneth Paltrow and Beyoncé had had a falling out. The reason? Amber Rose suggested that Gwyneth was Beyoncé's "Becky with the good hair."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The jaw-dropping rumor gained traction on social media, so much so that Amber Rose formally recanted her comment, pointing out that it was entirely a joke.</p><p>For her part, Paltrow was not content to let the rumor simply fizzle out; her representative confirmed in 2018 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the rumor was "completely absurd and 100 percent false,"</a> according to People.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Did Beyoncé Reference The Solange Elevator Drama On Her New Album?">Did Beyoncé Reference The Solange Elevator Drama On Her New Album?</a></span></p><p>What's more, People elaborated, Gwyneth and Bey remained friends at that time, and were "very close."</p><p>Yet the last time Gwyneth seemed to have publicly mentioned Beyoncé was in a 2016 interview. In that interview, Yahoo noted, Paltrow noted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé was "very shy" and "dialed down."</a></p><p>For anyone still confused about the two celebs' relationship, it makes a bit more sense to know that Beyoncé is more "basic" when she's offstage — more aligned with the seemingly chill Paltrow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-gwyneth-paltrow-and-beyonce-still-friends-today>Are Gwyneth Paltrow And Beyoncé Still Friends Today?</h2><p>While it's rumored that Paltrow has ended friendships in the past — <a href=#>including one with Madonna</a> — there doesn't seem to be any beef between her and Beyoncé today.</p><p>Like other celebrities, the two are both very busy living their respective lives and maintaining their careers.</p><p>Plus, though she and her ex-husband were close with Bey and Jay-Z, it makes sense that Gwyneth may have dialed back her friendship during her divorce.</p><p>Though she and Chris split rather amicably (remember their conscious uncoupling?), that doesn't mean they continued to maintain the friendships of their coupledom.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Happened Between Beyoncé And Madonna?">What Happened Between Beyoncé And Madonna?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though it's been a few years since either Beyonce or Gwyneth name-dropped the other, it does seem that they have maintained a low-key friendship during that time.</p><p>At the very least, they haven't dragged each other, so that suggests they don't have the acrimonious former-friend relationship that, say, Gwyneth has with Madonna.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dl7K6u82cnGafp667psDHZqeapKSnvLh50q2gpaRdm7%2Bqsc2dqmasn5muuns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./harry-potter-s-evanna-lynch-channels-luna-lovegood-to-banish-trolls.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harry Potter's Evanna Lynch Channels Luna Lovegood to Banish Trolls">&larr;
