Also hosted by regular presenter Julie Chen, the ten-episode series is perhaps best remembered for <a href=#>the dramatic hush that fell on the house when she announced</a> that Donald Trump had won the 2016 presidential election.BBOTT - as it is often stylized - was different from the original Big Brother format in that there was a greater focus on live, unedited footage. The audience was also much more involved in the process than usual, as they were allowed to cast a vote towards who would be evicted.In total, 13 contestants took part in the show, with none of them having had any solid, prior claim to fame. More than half a decade later, this reality has not changed significantly for most of them, with a lot of their celebrity still only coming from their association with Big Brother. We take a look at where seven of these contestants are, and what they are doing with their lives today.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here Are The Richest 'Big Brother' Contestants</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=morgan-and-alex-willett-are-fashion-travel-and-fitness-enthusiasts><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Morgan And Alex Willett Are Fashion, Travel And Fitness Enthusiasts</span></h2><p>One of the interesting aspects of Big Brother: Over the Top was that it actually featured two sisters: Morgan and Alexandra 'Alex' Willett from Texas. Although the latter is in fact three years older, it was Morgan who made more of an impact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">emerging the overall winner of the show</a>.</p><p>After Big Brother, Morgan Willett continued her reality television career by joining both Ex on the Beach and a season of The Challenge. She famously became linked to Challenge legend, Johnny Bananas. According to Morgan and Alex's social media profiles, the sisters are now focused on their passions of fitness, fashion and travel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-roy-is-still-living-off-his-big-brother-fame-on-social-media><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jason Roy Is Still Living Off His 'Big Brother' Fame On Social Media</span></h2><p>Jason Roy was a supermarket cashier from Swansea, Massachusetts when he was cast on Big Brother: Over the Top.

Lee had been very supportive of her from the beginning of her time on the show, saying, "I don't know if CBS could have chosen somebody with a bigger heart."</p><p>He proposed shortly after she was evicted, which was a very worthwhile consolation for Hogg.

It is not clear whether Massongill is still pursuing his engineering background, with nothing related to the field being mentioned in any of his bios on social media.
