Although he doesn't act anymore, <a href=#>Bruce Willis has maintained his high net worth</a>. However, his days are consumed by his difficult illness.

Willis and Emma Hemming's first daughter Mabel Ray Willis was born on April 1st, 2012, and much of the interview centered around his love for his second-youngest child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fans-found-the-final-interview-that-bruce-willis-was-actually-himself.jpg><p>He also talked about the aging process in this interview, and he shared a heartbreaking perspective on death that feels chilling now that his health has gotten to this point. When asked if he was upset about getting older, Willis said, "No. I’m completely comfortable being this age." He continued:</p><p>"I know, from an intellectual point of view, that I’m getting older. I see myself getting older. But I don’t feel older yet.

He said:</p><p>"When you’re in your 50s, the statistical average is, you’re gonna be dead in the next 20 to 40 years.

Many people learn to appreciate life and be present every day when they have gone through a trauma, health scare, or prolonged period of illness. Instead, Willis had a positive attitude about enjoying his life even before something was wrong.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Willis' Five Children</a></p></th><th scope=col><p>Birthdays And Ages (According to People)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Evelyn Penn Willis</p></td><td><p>May 5th, 2014 (9 years old)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mabel Ray Willis</p></td><td><p>April 1st, 2012 (11 years old)</p></td></tr><tr><td>Tallulah Belle Willis</td><td><p>February 3rd, 1994 (30 years old)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Scout LaRue Willis</p></td><td><p>July 20th, 1991 (32 years old)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rumer Glen Willis</p></td><td><p>August 16th, 1988 (35 years old)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even before Bruce Willis was diagnosed with dementia, he talked about his age in many interviews.
