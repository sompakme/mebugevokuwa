Her birthday is not easily found online as she has not stated her exact date of birth. Dershowitz was born on September 1, 1938.</p><p>An article by People in 1990 identifies Cohen as being 39 years old at the time when Dershowitz was 51. Probably by calculating from her husband’s Allan age, Carolyn is 70 years. This section is still under review and will be updated as soon as it is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-height></span>Carolyn Cohen Height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Carolyn </b>stands at an&nbsp;<strong>average height</strong>&nbsp;and has&nbsp;<strong>moderate weight</strong>. She appears to be quite tall in stature of her photos, relative to her surroundings, which are anything to go by. However, details regarding her actual height and other body measurements are currently not publicly available. We are keeping tabs and will update this information once it is out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-education></span>Carolyn Cohen Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cohen has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology.

Our efforts to find out more about her <strong>family</strong>&nbsp;came to no avail as no such information is publicly available. Thus, the identity of&nbsp;<strong>Carolyn’s parents</strong>&nbsp;is still unclear. It is also not known if she has any siblings. Nevertheless, this section will be updated as soon as it is available.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-and-alan-dershowitz></span>Carolyn Cohen and Alan Dershowitz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carolyn is the second wife to Alan Dershowitz. Dershowitz and Cohen have been married since 1986. Her husband Alan was previously married to the late Sue Barlach. In his book Chutzpah, he described Sue as an “Orthodox Jewish girl.” The two met during high school at a Jewish summer camp in the Catskills. They tied the knot in 1959 when Alan was age 20 and Sue was 18 years old.</p><p>Sue and Alan had two sons together: Elon Dershowitz who was born in 1961 and Jamin Dershowitz who was born in&nbsp; 1963. Elon is a film producer while Jamin is an attorney. Sue and Alan separated in 1973 and divorced in 1976. Sue was initially given custody of the kids. Alan fought for and was later awarded full custody of their children.</p><p>The New Yorker reported that Sue later worked as a research librarian and “drowned in the East River, in an apparent suicide” on New Year’s Eve, 1983.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-husband-alan-dershowitz></span>Carolyn Cohen Husband Alan Dershowitz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carolyn’s husband, Alan, is an American lawyer and legal scholar known for his scholarship of U.S. constitutional law.

He was born on 1 September 1938, New York, New York, United States. He celebrates his birth on September 1 every year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-children></span>Carolyn Cohen&nbsp; Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cohen and Alan Dershowitz have a Daughter named, Ella Dershowitz. She graduated from Yale and became a Professional Actress in New York City. Ella is now in her late 20s and working as an actress. She bucked the family’s loyalty to Harvard by attending rival Yale University.</p><p>Ella graduated with a degree in theater. Since college, Ella has added off-Broadway shows as well as television appearances to her resume. She is well-known for appearing in Can You Forgive Her at the Vineyard Theater alongside actress <strong>Amber Tamblyn</strong> in 2017; the 2014 comedic show Intimacy; Twelfth Night; and The Screenwriter’s Daughter.</p><p>Her TV resume includes appearances on shows including The Affair on Showtime, Knife Fight, and Lie To Me on Fox.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-net-worth></span>Carolyn Cohen Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carolyn’s net worth is estimated to be between $1 to $3 million dollars.

She also joined her husband as a staffer at Harvard. Cohen was a supervisor and clinician at Harvard Medical School. She is listed as one of the co-authors of a study published by the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. The research team spent 12 years following 120 children and adolescents they defined as “high-risk.”</p><p>The goal was to study how a person’s cognitive skills and deficits impacted their “psychopathology and recovery.” They also analyzed the young people’s mental health and risk for suicide as they transitioned into adulthood. She has as well been listed as the co-author of multiple studies published by prominent medical journals.</p><p>One of those, published in 1992 in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, worked to develop a system for testing cognitive function in elderly patients. Cohen is also named in a 1991 study published in JAMA Neurology, about Alzheimer’s and dementia.</p><p>It appears that Carolyn did not limit her work to just the northeast, or to just research. Cohen and her husband Alan also own a home in Miami Beach, and Cohen appears to have had a psychology practice there. An inactive LinkedIn page names Cohen as retired psychology in Miami Beach.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-philanthropist></span>Carolyn Cohen Philanthropist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cohen is a person who seeks to promote the welfare of others, especially by the generous donation of money to good causes. She was a clinical psychologist. As referenced above, she worked on a research team that followed at-risk children and analyzed their development and mental health. But Cohen didn’t limit her interaction with children to just her research. She also volunteered in at least two of her communities.</p><p>According to the website Little Sis, which is maintained by a non-profit research group called the Public Accountability Initiative, Cohen worked as a volunteer for several years. She helped serve children in impoverished neighborhoods in Boston and Miami. She also reportedly served on boards that worked to provide opportunities and assistance to children and their families in underprivileged areas.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=carolyn-cohen-house></span>Carolyn Cohen House<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carolyn and her husband Alan Dershowitz have plenty of places to go and unwind. They own homes in Martha’s Vineyard, Miami Beach, and Manhattan. Alan is originally from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, but he and Cohen chose the upscale neighborhood Sutton Place on the east side of Manhattan to call home. The duo paid $1.68 million in 2012 for a three-bedroom apartment on the 16th floor, at 45 Sutton Place.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-carolyn-cohen></span>Frequently Asked Questions About Carolyn Cohen<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-carolyn-cohen></span>Who is Carolyn Cohen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Carolyn Cohen is an American neuropsychologist well-known as the second wife of Alan Dershowitz, &nbsp;an American lawyer and legal scholar known for his scholarship of the U.S.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-carolyn-cohen></span>How old is Carolyn Cohen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Carolyn was born in the United States, she has not shared her date of birth with the public, as it is not documented anywhere as of 2020.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-carolyn-cohen></span>How tall is Carolyn Cohen?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Carolyn stands at an average height, she has not shared her height with the public.
