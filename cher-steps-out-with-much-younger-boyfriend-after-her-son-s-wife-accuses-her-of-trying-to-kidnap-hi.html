According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">court documents obtained by PEOPLE</a>, which were submitted as part of the ongoing divorce between Cher’s son, Elijah Blue Allman, and his estranged wife, Marie King, who is alleging the 77-year old hired men to kidnap her son after becoming concerned for his well-being.</p><p>As per the court records, King, 36, claims that her mother-in-law, Cher, 77, enlisted the assistance of four individuals to escort her 47-year-old son out of their New York hotel room on November 30, 2022, coinciding with their wedding anniversary.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cher's Contentious Relationship With Son Elijah Blue Allman Deteriorated When He Was Just A Child</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple were reportedly spending time alone in New York to work on their marriage, when the attempted abduction took place. King says that rather than allow them to mend their marriage, Cher was trying to intervene by setting up the kidnapping.</p><p>King claims that one of the men informed her Cher had hired them as the abduction was carried out. As stated in the documents, King said she was unaware of where her husband currently is (though this could’ve changed, given the filing was made months ago).</p><p>“I am currently unaware of my husband's wellbeing or whereabouts,” King stated in the documents. “I am very concerned and worried about him.”</p><h2 id=cher-has-been-accused-of-interfering-in-her-son-39-s-life-before>Cher Has Been Accused Of Interfering In Her Son's Life Before</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar52495242.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I understand his family’s efforts to make sure he is well, and I want what is best for my husband,” she continued.</p><p>King added that this wasn’t the first time Cher got in the middle of their marriage. The superstar reportedly instructed King to leave their shared family home in 2022 without getting her personal belongings, after Allman was admitted to a treatment facility, which King says was done without her knowledge.</p><p>For now, Cher hasn’t publicly commented on the accusations. Elijah and Marie’s divorce remains ongoing.</p><p>Allman is Cher's younger son, who was born in 1976 during her previous marriage to the late Greg Allman, a member of The Allman Brothers Band. They were wed from 1975 to 1979. Following thir divorce, Greg Allman distanced himself from his son until they re-established a connection prior to his passing in 2017. Cher and Elijah have also been vocal about their periods of estrangement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cher has one older child, son Chaz, born in 1969, whom she welcomed with her ex Sonny Bono.
