It started before&nbsp;The Wendy Williams Show when she was still a radio DJ and host. She gained popularity&nbsp;for making plenty of enemies in&nbsp;the show business, including the legendary Whitney Houston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the 90s to 00s, Whitney Houston's personal life was under the media microscope, mostly for her drug use. But Wendy dove into deeper personal stuff. She talked a lot about Whitney's lesbian relationship&nbsp;with her friend, Robyn Crawford. At that time, Whitney&nbsp;was married to Bobby Brown so it was just&nbsp;this nasty rumor the tabloids supposedly made up.</p><p>But in 2019 Robyn publicly confirmed the affair in&nbsp;her&nbsp;memoir,&nbsp;A Song for You: My Life with Whitney Houston. She also came to&nbsp;The Wendy Williams Show&nbsp;to talk about it and&nbsp;tell Wendy what Whitney really thought of her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Wendy Williams Criticized After Declaring She Will Not Take COVID-19 Vaccine" href=#>Wendy Williams Criticized After Declaring She Will Not Take COVID-19 Vaccine</a></span></p><h2 id=whitney-didn-t-like-the-way-wendy-talked-about-her>Whitney Didn't Like The Way Wendy Talked About Her</h2><p>To be fair, many celebrities never liked the way Wendy talked about them either. But according to Robyn Crawford, what Whitney didn't particularly like was&nbsp;that Wendy talked about them as if&nbsp;she&nbsp;was their roommate.&nbsp;"We get in the car, and you're talking like you lived with us," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robyn told Wendy</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Whitney would say, 'Who theâ€”who is she? Who is this woman? I don't even know what she looks like.'" Robyn said that it was a lot of pressure for The Bodyguard&nbsp;star who only wanted to sing and touch people. Whitney had always been vocal about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">struggles of living in the public eye</a>.</p><p>She loved her fans but she was also afraid of them. She revealed that before&nbsp;performing live, she would stay in her room for days just trying to get her anxious self together. Her mom, Cissy Houston had also tried to keep&nbsp;her&nbsp;away from the&nbsp;industry which she&nbsp;knew would be ruinous for her talented daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Brandy On Working With Whitney Houston And The Cultural Impact Of 'Cinderella,' Set To Premiere On Disney+" href=#>Brandy On Working With Whitney Houston And The Cultural Impact Of 'Cinderella,' Set To Premiere On Disney+</a></span></p><h2 id=wendy-s-heated-first-interview-with-a-cumulative-fed-up-whitney>Wendy's Heated First Interview With A "Cumulative, Fed-Up" Whitney</h2><p>Remember that 2003 radio interview when Whitney&nbsp;finally dueled with Wendy to defend herself from&nbsp;the&nbsp;inflammable gossips thrown at her? "That was a cumulative, fed-up Whitney Houston that I heard," Robyn described to Wendy. "You had been talking about Whitney and myself for so long."</p><p>"Well, that's what I do," Wendy explained. She said all the rumors came true and were validated in Robyn's memoir anyway. Whitney denied all those allegations to Wendy back then. Regardless of the facts that have recently come to light, fans still believe that Whitney had put Wendy in her place in that interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">typical nosy Wendy fashion</a>, the&nbsp;Hot Topics host asked the Grammy Hall of Famer invasive questions&nbsp;about&nbsp;money issues, drug use,&nbsp;and&nbsp;her sex life. Whitney&nbsp;was cussing throughout the show, clearly upset about Wendy's intrusiveness. She even asked if Whitney's mom was dating. "Yes, she does. She minds her business, too,"&nbsp;the singer clapped back.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Will We Ever See The Original 'Wendy Williams Movie' Starring Robin Givens?" href=#>Will We Ever See The Original 'Wendy Williams Movie' Starring Robin Givens?</a></span></p><h2 id=whitney-once-planned-to-wait-for-wendy-outside-her-work-to-have-a-chat>Whitney Once Planned To Wait For Wendy Outside Her Work To "Have A Chat"</h2><p>That radio interview has left a permanent public impression of what Wendy and Whitney's relationship was like. Obviously, Whitney didn't appreciate Wendy's hustle.&nbsp;Before that infamous interview, Robyn revealed that she and Whitney had actually planned on waiting for Wendy outside her work. "You were gonna jump me?" Wendy asked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We didn't know what you looked like and our plan was to go down to Hudson Street and squat like collies waiting for you," Robyn explained. Wendy said that she would have run, but&nbsp;Robyn clarified that they didn't want to fight. "We just wanted to see you face-to-face and have a chat." A chat...</p><p>But that's actually believable. Whitney told Wendy in their interview that she wanted to be friends with her. At that point, Whitney was no longer having it and was extremely defensive in answering the questions. Wendy asked if she was that defensive to her friends, too. Whitney said no and emphasized&nbsp;the difference between wanting to be friends and being&nbsp;friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seemed like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most awarded female artist of all time</a> was only calling out&nbsp;the Queen of Gossip&nbsp;for talking about her like she knew her. It didn't sound like Whitney had any deep hatred for Wendy.&nbsp;Wendy has&nbsp;also been&nbsp;a big fan of the singer so she didn't have any intention of destroying her image.&nbsp;Maybe if they'd met in person, say at The Wendy Williams Show, they might have had a fun time firing sass shots at each other.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Whitney Houston Fans Think She Was 'Sacrificed' After New Details Of Her Death Emerge" href=#>Whitney Houston Fans Think She Was 'Sacrificed' After New Details Of Her Death Emerge</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdrLWqwM2esGagn6rAtbvNZqmemZyhxm60wK2cZq%2BVo7G6edaio6WhkaLAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ed-sheeran-reveals-who-isn-t-a-fan-of-his-music.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ed Sheeran Reveals Who Isnt A Fan Of His Music">&larr;
