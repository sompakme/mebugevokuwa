He's the type of actor who appears in a lot of projects and has a recognizable face, but not necessarily a recognizable name. He began his career appearing in music videos. He made his film debut in Without You I'm Nothing and earned widespread recognition for his role as Cinqu√© in the Steven Spielberg film Amistad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hounsou also starred in America and Blood Diamond, receiving nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for both of those films. One of his most iconic roles was when he appeared as an antagonist in Furious 7 <a href=#>alongside feuding actors Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel</a>. At the end of the day, Hounsou's biggest role by far was when he appeared in one of the biggest movies of all time, Gladiator. He has a huge net worth, and his appearance in Gladiator plays a huge part in that. Here's everything to know.</p><h2 id=what-is-djimon-hounsou-39-s-net-worth>What Is Djimon Hounsou's Net Worth?</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Hounsou has a net worth of $12 million. He began his career as a model in Paris in the early 1990s. He appeared in campaigns for Calvin Klein, Yves Saint Laurent, and Dior. He also starred in music videos for artists such as Madonna and En Vogue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kimora-and-Djimon-Kenzo-son-promo-2-e1605066944659.jpg><p>In addition to his film work, Hounsou has also appeared in several television series, including Amazon's The Expanse and the Starz series Black Sails. He has also starred in several music videos, including "Sweetest Taboo" by Sade and "Love and Happiness" by Maxwell.</p><p>Hounsou's net worth is largely derived from his acting career. He has also earned money from modeling and from his endorsement deals. He is a highly successful actor with a long list of credits to his name.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-djimon-hounsou-make-from-starring-in-gladiator>How Much Money Did Djimon Hounsou Make From Starring In Gladiator?</h2><p>According to Screen Rant, it is estimated that Hounsou made between $500,000 and $1 million for the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gladiator was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $500 million worldwide. This made it the highest-grossing film of 2000. Hounsou's performance in the film was also critically acclaimed, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6F166FB2-D007-477B-865B-241048DA14EE.jpeg><p>Hounsou's performance in Gladiator was critically acclaimed, and he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. This would have also helped him to negotiate a higher salary for future roles, so in a way, Gladiator netted Hounsou a large chunk of his $12 million net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hounsou's time on Gladiator came with some crazy stories, including one iconic piece in film history. During the filming of the fight scenes in the Colosseum, Hounsou accidentally came close to stabbing someone in the head with his sword. He later recalled the incident during an interview with Variety, saying "I almost accidentally stabbed somebody in the head in the fight sequence in the Colosseum when Maximus gets on the horse. Most of us got carried away, and I think I was one of the few who didn't get hurt".</p><p>Hounsou had never fought with a sword before being cast in Gladiator. He had to train for months to learn how to use a sword and to perform the fight scenes in the film. He later said that learning how to fight with a sword was one of the most challenging things he has ever done.</p><p>In addition to all of that craziness, <a href=#>Russell Crowe almost fought a real tiger</a> during a fight scene gone wrong, which really showed how committed the cast of the film was.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Russell Crowe Lost Over 40 Pounds Ahead Of Gladiator</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Aside from the awards and money, Hounsou walked away from the movie with a close friendship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hounsou and Crowe became close friends during the filming of Gladiator</a>. They have remained friends ever since, with Crowe claiming that Hounsou is one of his closest friends.</p><h2 id=what-does-djimon-hounsou-spend-his-12-million-on>What Does Djimon Hounsou Spend His $12 Million On?</h2><p>Djimon Hounsou has spent his Gladiator money on some rather lavish things. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to DIRT</a>, Hounsou owns a home in Los Angeles, California, and a home in his native Benin. He also owns a vacation home in the Maldives.</p><p>Hounsou is a collector of art, and he has a large collection of African art. He has also donated art to museums and galleries.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Mike Tyson's Net Worth Is So Low After Losing Most Of His $400 Million Fortune, Here's What Happened</a></span></p><p>Hounsou is a car enthusiast, and he owns a collection of luxury cars.
