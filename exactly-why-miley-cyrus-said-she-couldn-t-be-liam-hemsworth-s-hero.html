Their on-and-off relationship was a rollercoaster for the world watching, and to this day, the known reason for their split is “irreconcilable differences.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there were many rumors and speculations surrounding the divorce, there were no clear statements about the true reason they got divorced for good. The fans are left to gather the pieces that Cyrus gives them now and then in her interviews, live shows, and songs, to finally put the puzzle together.</p><p>Cyrus has said before that her marriage was an attempt to save herself, that <a href=#>her marriage to Hemsworth was a disaster</a>, and that she will always love him. One of the things she has said was in a song on her latest record, “Plastic Hearts.” In the song called, “WT* Do I Know,” she sang that she couldn’t be somebody’s hero, which she later admitted was about Hemsworth. But how did this start, how did they get to that point, and what else did Cyrus say?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-rsquo-s-on-and-off-relationship>Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth’s On-And-Off Relationship</h2><p>It all started on the set of the movie, “The Last Song,” in 2009, and ended with a divorce in 2020.</p><p>In 2009, shortly after they met, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyrus called Hemsworth her best friend</a> in an MTV interview. The following year, they walked their first red carpet, making their relationship official to the world. From there on, their relationship takes twists and turns, where they break up and get back together. Then in 2012, Hemsworth talked about falling in love with Cyrus. In the same year, they got engaged, and <a href=#>their relationship was too sweet to ignore</a>.</p><p>That year was full of changes for Cyrus as she shaved her head, turned blonde, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyrus started dressing more boldly</a> in an attempt to break away from being the Disney star, Hannah Montana. Then came her 2013 VMAs performance with Robin Thicke. Twenty days after that performance, Cyrus and Hemsworth announced breaking off their engagement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not that this was the end of it.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2016, the couple got engaged again and got married in December 2018. However, it took less than nine months for them to announce their break-up and finalize their divorce in 2020 and go their separate ways.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus' Sweet New Year's Day Tribute To Ex-Husband Liam Hemsworth</a></span></p><p>With so many rumors regarding the breakup, to this day, no one really knows <a href=#>why they got divorced</a>. Regardless, Cyrus’ latest album, “Plastic Hearts,” which was released on November 2020, has many tracks that are obviously about a love story of some sort, especially the song, “WT* Do I Know.”</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus-says-she-couldn-rsquo-t-be-someone-rsquo-s-hero>Miley Cyrus Says She Couldn’t Be Someone’s Hero</h2><p>In the song, she sings:</p><p>"What the **** do I know? I'm alone</p><p>'Cause I couldn't be somebody's hero</p><p>You want an apology, not from me</p><p>Had to leave you in your own misery</p><p>So tell me, baby, am I wrong that I moved on and I</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And I don't even miss you?</p><p>Thought that it'd be you until I die</p><p>But I let go, what the **** do I know?"</p><p>While Cyrus was on the Howard Stern Show, Stern explicitly asked her about that track. He told her that it was apparent that the track is about her ex-husband, Hemsworth. To which she responded saying, “Most of it.” Stern went on and asked her if it’s true that she doesn’t spend a minute thinking about Hemsworth.</p><p>To that, Cyrus responded by explaining <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how her songwriting process goes</a>. She shared that when she was a child, she used to love catching fireflies in jars with her dad and watching them light up. Cyrus explained that to her, songwriting is just like that. Songwriting is about capturing something in herself that she has felt, even if just for a second.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Miley Cyrus Has Done Since Divorcing Liam Hemsworth</a></span></p><p>It doesn’t need to be her identity, but just a part of her somewhere, at some point in time. When she sings and says, “couldn’t be somebody’s hero,” Cyrus is true to herself and is just capturing a feeling that she has felt about her ex-husband, Hemsworth.</p><p>Cyrus wrote that specific song admitting that she doesn’t know much about the future. Her whole relationship with Hemsworth proved that whatever plan someone makes, life just laughs and shows them what is really going to happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans think that this is not the only track on Cyrus’ record that is about Hemsworth. There is also, “Angels Like You,” where she sings and says, “it's not your fault I can't be what you need,” and “Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me.” Another track that is very clearly about a love gone wrong is, “Never Be Me,” in which she sings, “If you're looking for someone to be all that you need, that'll never be me.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Facts About Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth's Marriage, Now That They're Divorced</a></span></p><p>If these lyrics were written about Cyrus’ ex-husband, Hemsworth, and she did feel those emotions at one point, then it is safe to say that the relationship took a wrecking ball to their lives. Clearly, Cyrus carries some guilt because of what she couldn’t be, but also has a lot of anger. This could be as much as we learn in this lifetime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijopmdYrWmudKwpqusmGK6qrjEsmScsaKqwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hailee-steinfeld-reveals-how-important-emily-and-sue-s-relationship-in-dickinson-is.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hailee Steinfeld Reveals How Important Emily And Sues Relationship In Dickinson Is">&larr;
