Since they were first spotted together in 2020, they weren't afraid to show off their affection in public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From steamy makeout sessions to matching tattoos, these two are all about the PDA. This is the same case when it comes to their arguments as both go to social media to either deny rumors, delete pictures with the other, or even hint at cheating. Then, as if nothing happened, they are back together, showing off their affection for each other during events or on social media.</p><p>But controversy and drama still emerge from their love story, no matter how much they try to assure everyone that things are good. Some people claim that their relationship is 'toxic,' while others found even scarier reasons why Megan Fox hasn't dumped Machine Gun Kelly definitely yet.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-and-machine-gun-kelly-seem-to-have-an-on-off-relationship>Megan Fox And Machine Gun Kelly Seem To Have An On/Off Relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/midnight-in-the-switchgrass-mgk-megan-fox.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Are they together or not? This is probably one of the most Googled questions regarding Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly's relationship. From their steamy romance to their shocking splits, the couple has kept their fans guessing about the state of their relationship.</p><p>One day they declare their undying love for each other on social media and the next day it seems like they just want to stay away from each other. Considering this chaotic timeline, fans still think that, no matter the status of their relationship, <a href=#>they will break up completely at some point</a>.</p><h2 id=more-on-mgk-and-megan-fox-39-s-rocky-relationship>More on Mgk and Megan Fox's Rocky Relationship</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Megan Fox And Machine Gun Kelly Fell In Love While Filming Midnight In The Switchgrass</a></span></p><p>This is because many people think their relationship isn't stable since it's very intense when they get together, and quite problematic. Within less than two years of dating, they got engaged, and fans had a lot to say about the ring which, from Machine Gun Kelly's explanation, could hurt Megan Fox if she tried to remove it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, they've said 'pause' to their engagement a few times, and each time they made sure it's a little bit public. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they work on their relationship after they reportedly broke up</a>, it seems that people still found some pretty scary reasons why they are still working on it and don't just call it off completely.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-hinted-at-mgk-39-s-infidelity-but-then-denied-it-39-s-real>Megan Fox Hinted At MGK's Infidelity But Then Denied It's Real</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/megan-fox-at-the-premiere-of-good-mourning-in-la.jpg><p>After one of their arguments, Megan Fox made some shocking decisions when it comes to her social media, even closing her account for some time. Still, before she did that, she let the world know that there is trouble in paradise. Even when this incident happened, <a href=#>people weren't sure if they broke up definitely</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After they partied the night before, Megan Fox deleted all photos with Machine Gun Kelly on her social media. While this action made it seem that they had problems, she also added a selfie in the bathroom, captioning it "You can taste the dishonesty/it’s all over your breath," which comes from Beyoncé's song about infidelity.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Bizarre Reason Megan Fox Asked If MGK Was Breastfed</a></span></p><p>Shortly after, she completely deactivated her Instagram account, prompting fans to think that Machine Gun Kelly cheated on her, and they were still fighting. Since Machine Gun Kelly and Sophie Lloyd, the guitarist, performed together a night before, many people thought she was the one with whom Machine Gun Kelly had an affair.</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophie Lloyd responded to the allegations and denied any rumors</a> shortly after. Even Megan Fox came back to Instagram to do the same, but fans still don't understand the meaning of her lyrics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-are-worried-about-megan-fox-39-s-well-being>Fans Are Worried About Megan Fox's Well-Being</h2><p>Because of that incident, fans found a pretty scary reason why Megan Fox denied any cheating allegations, and is still talking to Machine Gun Kelly. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to their fans</a>, their relationship is "full of toxicity," and, as a result, Megan Fox might want to put this love story in the past, but she simply can't.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Megan Fox Saved Machine Gun Kelly's Life Amid Mental Health Crisis</a></span></p><p>"I find it way more likely that there’s actual abuse going on, and she just doesn't have a clear, sane mind to talk about what she’s going through," wrote one fan, summarizing the overall opinion.</p><p>They also think this is also the reason why Megan Fox captioned her controversial picture with infidelity in mind, and then quickly denied any cheating allegations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/your-paragraph-text-17.png><p>Others think Megan Fox doesn't want to affect Machine Gun Kelly's health by leaving him, saying that he is a "dude with a history of stuff like [self harm] threats when he feels rejected."</p><p>With so much drama and speculation swirling around this high-profile couple, it's hard to know what to believe.
