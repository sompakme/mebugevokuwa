The premise was brilliant, and the show became a success on the small screen.</p><p>During the first season, relationship coach Jodi Rogers helped a number of the show's cast members, which included people like Michael, Kelvin, Chloe, Maddi, Olivia, Mark, Andrew and more, to learn dating norms assist them in finding love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After a successful debut season, a second one was right around the corner.

Though everyone wasn't able to find love, audiences couldn't help but root for each person being featured.</p><p>So far, there have only been two seasons of the Australian version of the show, but recently, the hit reality series made its was to the states with the hope of catching on with an even larger audience.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>According To Fans And Reviews, Is Netflix's 'The Lincoln Lawyer' Worth Watching?</a></span></p><h2 id=it-recently-crossed-the-pond>It Recently Crossed The Pond</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just this month, the newest version of Love on the Spectrum released on Netflix. Instead of being Down Under, the show headed stateside and focused on single adults finding love in a brand new setting.</p><p>This version of the show was very similar to its predecessor, which is a great thing. The original version struck a golden balance of social life, interviews, and dating life, and the showrunners were wise to keep things as uniform as possible.</p><p>The show's cast featured Dani, Abbey, Steve, Kaelynn, and James. Each cast member tried their hand at finding love, though all of them weren't successful. They all seemed ot have their moments, but ultimately, love came knocking for few of them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Cheat Sheet, "The couple is still together, and Abbey shared a personal video on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. Abbey and David are at a restaurant together. They introduce themselves, and someone asks, “And what do you want to say, Abbey?” “Thank you for introducing me to this handsome young man next to me,” Abbey says, pointing to David. “And thanks for introducing me to Abbey.” The person behind the camera then asks what night is it? “Valentine’s night!” she answers.

Australians were a lot more fluid in their search for a partner compared to the Americans who are all speaking from an heteronormative perspective. (I feel you can see being different or natural - at least on television - is less encouraged, as you said, in a lot of tv shows that have international versions.)," they wrote.</p><p>Another focused their comment on one of the show's most popular figures.</p><p>"James is an absolute gem. I was crying tears of laughter watching him and his parents banter. The whole bit where he thought he lost his checkbook, his mom offers to drive to two different banks only for him to discover it was in his desk all along. Lol. You can’t write this stuff for tv, it’s beautiful lol," the user wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And finally, one person summed up their feelings in a brief, but honest comment.</p><p>"Just finished the season, 10/10."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Netflix's 'Choose Or Die' A Horror Movie Worth Watching?</a></span></p><p>So far, the latest version of Love on the Spectrum is winning over fans everywhere.
