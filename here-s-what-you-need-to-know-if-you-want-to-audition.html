If you're unable to attend the live auditions, that doesn't mean you don't stand a chance. Anyone who wants to submit an online audition is free to do so, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Blurred</a> confirms that these auditions are evaluated exactly the same&nbsp;way the live auditions are. There's no detriment to auditioning online, whatsoever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=if-you-re-under-the-age-of-18-you-can-audition-with-a-guardian><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>If You're Under The Age of 18, You Can Audition With A Guardian</span></h2><p>We've all seen the young cuties on the show, and we love them! It's always a&nbsp;pleasant surprise&nbsp;to see the raw talent that some of these kids possess at such a young age. That leads us to our next point, which is that there is no age restriction on this show. Anyone under the age of 18 has to come with a parent or guardian that can take on&nbsp;a leadership role on behalf of young contestants.</p><h2 id=multiple-acts-are-accepted-each-with-their-own-protocols><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Multiple Acts Are&nbsp;Accepted, Each With Their Own Protocols</span></h2><p>There are multiple acts that are judged on this show. There are dancers, singers, and so much more. In order to fully prepare for your audition, it's important to look online to establish the rules and regulations within your particular category. Careful attention is required to ensure that your submission meets the criteria of the specific category you're auditioning for.

Before an audition is confirmed, each contestant must ensure their paperwork is accurately filled out, inclusive of the supporting documents such as photo ID, etc. Parents and guardians are expected to submit on behalf of minors.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are All The Champions Of America's Got Talent And What They're Doing Now</a></span></p><h2 id=there-are-8-open-call-auditions-that-take-place-in-person><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>There Are 8 Open Call Auditions That Take Place In Person</span></h2><p>If auditioning via video is not your thing, chances are you're in it for the full experience. While some contestants prefer to be able to record and re-record, giving them the ability to perfect their audition before hitting "send", others would rather feel all the feels and take in the full experience by attending an open audition. There are 8 open call auditions to select from, and they take place in multiple cities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-is-no-cost-to-audition><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>There Is No Cost To Audition</span></h2><p>One of the best parts of auditioning for America's Got Talent lies in the fact that there is no cost to the contestant. Well, there's no cost to actually audition, that is. Any out-of-pocket expenses required to travel to the city the audition is taking place in, and any accommodations or meals required, are at the expense of each contestant. There is absolutely no cost associated with the application process or audition process.</p><h2 id=you-can-audition-more-than-once><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>You Can Audition More Than Once</span></h2><p>If at first you don't success, try, try, try again! If you're hoping to pass the audition stage but didn't quite clinch a spot on your first try, there's no need to feel disheartened. One of the perks of America's Got Talent lies in the fact that multiple attempts are permitted. However, anyone attempting their audition multiple times needs to ensure they never apply in the same city twice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-are-dress-code-rules---pay-close-attention><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>There Are Dress Code Rules - Pay Close Attention!</span></h2><p>Anyone wishing to audition for America's Got Talent should be aware that while freedom of expression is welcome and encouraged, there are a few things to bear in mind when it comes to the dress code. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Talent Recap</a> reminds contestants that bright costumes and outfits are preferred and that people generally do well when they stand out. There's one thing they don't want to see though, and that's logos. No branding or logos of any kind are permitted on the stage.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">22 Things AGT Fans Don't Know About Heidi Klum And Tom Kaulitz's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=you-ll-receive-an-audition-number-and-wristband-to-ensure-your-audition-spot><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>You'll Receive An Audition Number And Wristband To Ensure Your Audition Spot</span></h2><p>Just when you thought it couldn't get more exciting, one of the most thrilling parts of the experience, that gives every contestant a rush, is when they are handed an audition number and they have their wristband put on. This not only makes things 'officially official', but it also ensures that only those who have qualified for this phase are permitted to move onward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=be-prepared-to-wait-all-day-to-audition><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Be Prepared To Wait All Day To Audition</span></h2><p>Not every part of the audition is a fun one. Contestants who want a shot on the stage of America's Got Talent will need to pack their patience. It comes as no surprise that hordes of people are equally excited about their shot at making it on the show, and this results in long, winding line ups that can last all day. The line typically wraps around the building and contestants are exposed to the elements during their wait time. That's just the beginning...</p><h2 id=you-ll-be-placed-in-a-holding-room-prior-to-going-to-the-audition-room><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>You'll Be Placed In A Holding Room Prior To Going To The Audition Room</span></h2><p>Once inside, contestants can expect to wait some more! The journey to the audition continues with a temporary placement in what's called the "holding room." This room is a busy one, and is packed with people who are nervous, excited, impatient, anxious, and also in line for their attempt to make it big. Many will use this time to practice their craft and put final touches on their performance, while others sit nervously trying to conserve their energy and compose themselves for their big chance. One thing they all have in common - they'll all be waiting in the holding room for a while!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=in-the-audition-room-auditions-last-less-than-2-minutes><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>In The Audition Room, Auditions Last Less Than 2 Minutes</span></h2><p>This has been quite a process so far and that's a whole lot of build up... for an audition that will last less than 2 minutes. Yes, you heard that correctly.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Talent Recap</a> reports that each audition is 90 seconds long, and reminds contestants that they "only have up to 90 seconds to show off your act, so make it count."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Julianne Hough's Time On America's Got Talent</a></span></p><h2 id=those-who-make-it-to-the-next-round-are-flown-to-southern-california><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Those Who Make It To The Next Round Are Flown To Southern California</span></h2><p>Those lucky enough to make it to the next round are lucky indeed. At no cost to them, contestants that make it to the next round are flown to Southern California for a chance of a lifetime. There is no cost associated with this part of the process, as the bill is picked up by NBC. This is when things get really serious and the competition kicks in!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=non-us-citizens-are-also-welcome><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Non-US Citizens Are Also Welcome!</span></h2><p>Given the fact that the show is called "America's" Got Talent, some will find it shocking to learn that this show embraces international talent. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RealityBlurred</a> reports that the show is open to anyone that can legally travel to the United States. As long as contestants carry the right Visa, this is open to talent from anywhere around the Globe.</p><h2 id=if-you-re-applying-repeatedly-the-entire-process-needs-to-be-started-from-scratch><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>If You're Applying Repeatedly, The Entire Process Needs To Be Started From Scratch</span></h2><p>It's amazing to be able to attempt this process as many times as you'd like. However, while there's no restriction to the number of times a contestant can try,&nbsp;there is one teeny tiny catch... they have to launch the process all over again from the very start. Those who feel they made an improvement since their last audition and are willing to try this again, can certainly do so - in a different city - and by relaunching the process from scratch!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Times Simon Cowell Was Savage AF</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYpp2inrCiv4ygpq1lpJa5prrTZq6hmaRixrDBjKecnpxdqbxut82ormahlmLGsMGMsJinrF2pvG6t1J2graGfo3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./selena-gomez-and-benny-blanco-host-birthday-party-for-nicola-peltz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco Host Birthday Party for Nicola Peltz">&larr;
