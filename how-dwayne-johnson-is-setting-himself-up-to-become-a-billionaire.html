Yes, things haven't always been smooth, including <a href=#>his feud with Vin Diesel</a>, but Johnson has prevailed and forged a legacy and a net worth few can rival.</p><p>At this stage of his career, he's still ramping things up, and unbelievably, the man is well on track to become a billionaire. How is he making this happen? Let's take a closer look at Dwayne Johnson and the brilliant moves that he's been making.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-is-worth-800-million>Dwayne Johnson Is Worth $800 Million</h2><p>Hollywood titan, Dwayne Johnson, is one of the industry's biggest names, and this has come on the heels of tireless work and success in multiple facets of entertainment. Thanks to his indomitable work ethic, Johnson has risen to the top, amassing a net worth of $800 million along the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The WWE was the place where it all started for Johnson, who rocketed to the top of professional wrestling as The Rock. From there, he would cross into acting, where he was able to land lead roles in features. It took some time, but Johnson eventually turned into a powerhouse on the big screen.</p><p>These days, it's almost impossible to find a movie star as big as Dwayne Johnson. Whether he is revitalizing a franchise like the Fast & Furious, taking things to the next level with Jumanji, or anchoring a Disney classic with Jungle Cruise, Johnson is larger than life on the big screen and forging a lasting legacy in the business.</p><p>After proving time and time again that he is a bankable star, Johnson has been pulling down massive paychecks for years now.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Scenes Dwayne Johnson Wishes He Could Take Back</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dj-39-s-making-millions-with-his-acting-and-producing>DJ's Making Millions With His Acting And Producing</h2><p>When making his big screen debut for The Scorpion King, Johnson pulled down a record-breaking debut salary of $5.5 million at the time. Things were uneven for years, but once he became a star, he took his salary to unprecedented heights.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, "His per-movie upfront salary first topped $20 million with 2018's Skyscraper. He earned $43 million in 2013. He earned $65 million in 2015. Between June 2017 and June 2018, Dwayne Johnson earned $125 million, making him by far the highest paid actor on the planet."</p><p>Johnson is paid well for being a movie star, yes, but he also gets producer fees thanks to his company, Seven Bucks Productions, which has had a hand in huge films like Shazam, Hobbs & Shaw, Jungle Cruise and Red Notice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you think this is an impressive feat, just wait until you hear what he's been cooking up in the investment department.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Howard Stern Trolled Dwayne Johnson Over Crushing On His 'Scorpion King' Co-Star</a></span></p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-39-s-tequila-brand-39-teremana-39-is-off-to-a-record-breaking-start>Dwayne Johnson's Tequila Brand 'Teremana' Is Off To A Record-Breaking Start</h2><p>If there is one thing that Dwayne Johnson is especially good at doing, it's letting the world know all the major moves that he's making. Over on his social media, Johnson has been celebrating the success of Teremana, his tequila company, which is off to a record-breaking start.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, Johnson revealed, "Our numbers were disclosed earlier this week and our Teremana growth is truly unprecedented. Our sales have exceeded over 600,000 nine-liter cases and in our spirits industry, that's an all-time record for first year sales. For context, George Clooney sold his Casamigos tequila brand to Diageo for $1 billion dollars and they were selling approximately 170,000 cases. Teremana is currently selling over 600,000 cases. So you can extrapolate the math and valuation, astounding growth and I think it reflects our 'highest in quality and best in taste' mantra."</p><p>The actor also has his hands in other investments, which are all showing positive momentum.</p><p>"And the other businesses in my portfolio have shown tremendous growth and moved along nicely in 2021 -- Teremana Tequila, ZOA Energy, Project Rock and XFL," he said.</p><p>The sheer impact of his tequila brand alone is staggering, and at this rate, it won't be long before his net worth skyrockets past the $1 billion mark. As his other projects grow, he could be looking at a future that sees him become the richest man on the big screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Dany Garcia And Dwayne Johnson Made Their Divorce A Good Experience</a></span></p><p>Dwayne Johnson is on track to be a billionaire in due time, meaning that he's come a long way from having just $7 bucks in his pocket.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Fans Roasted Howard Stern And Robin Quivers For Being Completely Wrong About Dwayne Johnson</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibsJmpo7Juts6hpaynnmKvqrjLoqanmZmnsm68y5qlZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2ahnpi8rrGO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-write-2-weeks-notice-email.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to write 2 weeks notice email">&larr;
