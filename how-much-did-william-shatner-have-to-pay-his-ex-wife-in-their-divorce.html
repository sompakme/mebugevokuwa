After all, almost all of the major movies that were set to be released that year were postponed for months on end and it is still unclear when many of them will come out. Despite that, it could still easily be argued that 2021 is a great time to be an actor. After all, there are so many shows and movies being produced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">during the pandemic</a> that there arguably are more successful actors than at any other time in history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though there are so many actors who’ve managed to make a name for themselves in recent years, there are only a handful of Hollywood performers who truly are legends. When it comes to William Shatner, even if he never acts again, he will go down in history as one of the best-known actors of all time.</p><p>Given all of the success that William Shatner has enjoyed, it makes sense that many people adore him to this day. However, given the fact that Shatner hasn’t appeared in a major movie in a while, a lot of people have stopped paying much attention to his personal life. For example, many of Shatner’s fans are unaware that he got divorced in 2020, let alone the fascinating details of the settlement he came to with his now ex-wife.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">William Shatner Advises Aspiring Actors So They Don’t Get Robbed By Their Agents</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-acting-legend>An Acting Legend</h2><p>When you look back on the careers of actors like Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, and Denzel Washington, it could be argued that several of the movies they starred in were their most impactful. On the other hand, when people look back on William Shatner’s time in the spotlight, there is no doubt at all that he is best known for bringing Star Trek’s Captain James T. Kirk to life.</p><p>After debuting as Captain Kirk in television’s original Star Trek series, William Shatner has gone on to play the character <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">repeatedly over the years</a>. Most notably, Shatner played Kirk on the big screen in several hit movies. While it is amazing that Shatner brought Captain Kirk to life so many times over the years, the most important thing is that his portrayal of the character was truly beloved by legions of fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Actors Who Became Legendary From Just One Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-unique-divorce>A Unique Divorce</h2><p>When most celebrities get divorced, the headlines often tend to focus on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">massive numbers</a> that are negotiated as a part of their settlement. For example, when the details of William Shatner’s 2020 divorce were revealed, the public learned that he paid his ex-wife Elizabeth a lump sum of $2 million.</p><p>While it was fascinating enough to learn that Shatner paid his ex-wife $2 million as a part of his divorce, the way they divided their assets was much more interesting. For example, as it turns out, Elizabeth and William Shatner are both very passionate about their horses so they worked out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an elaborate deal</a> to split them. As a result, the couple divided up their horses. More notably, William even agreed to give Elizabeth the right to visit the horses he was keeping as long as she gave him advance notice when she was coming. If that wasn’t remarkable enough, their divorce agreement stipulated that William got to keep "all horse semen" and horse equipment since he is a breeder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of the homes William and Elizabeth Shatner bought together, “she gets their Malibu Cove home and their home in Versailles, Kentucky and a share of her family farm in Indiana.”. Amazingly enough, William is keeping is a ranch in Three Rivers, California that Elizabeth gets visitation rights to since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her first husband’s grave</a> resides there. On top of her visitation rights, Elizabeth “gets to 'occasionally harvest some fruit' from the trees at the ranch.” Additionally, Elizabeth will keep a 2015 Mercedes Benz ML65, 2007 BMW X5, and a 2004 Ford Explorer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Breaking Down Garth Brooks' $125 Million Divorce Settlement</a></span></p><h2 id=william-s-romantic-past>William’s Romantic Past</h2><p>In Hollywood, so many celebrity marriages have quickly fallen apart that it no longer seems overly noteworthy a lot of the time. Considering that William Shatner’s most recent marriage lasted nearly twenty years, he certainly beat the odds in that regard. Unfortunately for Shatner, however, his most recent marriage is far from his only one that has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gone down in flames</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Married for the first time back in 1956, William Shatner and Gloria Rand would go on to get divorced in 1969. Four years later, Shatner would walk down the aisle again and his second marriage wound being his longest lasting as he stayed with Marcy Lafferty from 1973 until 1996. Unfortunately, the third of Shatner’s four marriages fell apart a lot quicker as he wed Nerine Kidd in 1997 and they went their separate ways in 1999.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">William Shatner Defends LGBTQ Community After Refusing To Take Sides On ObamaDay</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lp565rbXApmSsoJGpu6a%2BjKGYr51dqbxuvMCyZKGho2KyuXnWop2eZZmjerW0xKKpZpyZq7yzr8Ro</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./king-charles-delivers-commonwealth-day-address-amid-royal-drama.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="King Charles Delivers Commonwealth Day Address Amid Royal Drama">&larr;
