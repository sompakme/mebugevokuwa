His signature&nbsp;childish humor challenges racial stereotypes and derives from his upbringing as an Indo-Canadian. <a href=#>Comedic genius Chris Rock</a> referred to him as 'the most famous person nobody's ever heard of' due to his challenging breakthrough in the United States and his record-breaking success nearly everywhere else.&nbsp;In 2008, Peters was appointed as Toronto's first Global Ambassador, and in 2011, he was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame. Since 2009, Forbes magazine has often ranked him among the <a href=#>highest-earning comedians in the world</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=early-life-amp-troubled-childhood>Early Life & Troubled Childhood</h2><p>The Catholic, Anglo-Indian Peters was born in Toronto to Indian immigrants Eric and Maureen in 1965. Peters's family moved to the neighboring city of Brampton when he was a child, where he faced racism while growing up. His classmates made fun of his brown skin and called him "Paki." His father told him to use words to defend himself, and Peters recognized he was basically fighting stupidity.</p><p>Peters suffered in school due in large part to untreated ADHD. After being expelled from "normal school" in Grade 10 owing to poor academic performance, he registered in the vocational North Peel High School. However, the inclusive environment fostered by North Peel's varied student body helped Peters. Since graduating from high school in 1989, he has established a scholarship for alumni.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Kevin Hart Way: The Comedian's 10 Rules To Achieve Success</a></span></p><h2 id=the-exploration-of-a-great-career>The Exploration Of A Great Career</h2><p>After graduation, Peters submitted an application to Sheridan College. His application was denied, so he attended Sheridan as a DJ, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">performing as DJ Russell</a> on the campus radio station. He also explored a profession in stand-up comedy, delivering his first set at Yuk Yuk's Comedy Club on an amateur night at age 19. In 1992, he had a chance encounter with the great comic George Carlin, who instructed him to take advantage of every performance opportunity. Peters took the advice and performed extensively across Canada, frequently without compensation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Peters achieved prominence in 1995 when he appeared on the CBC television program Comics! His controversial humor, which included imitating a Black man who mispronounces Indian names with sexual undertones, prompted both fan mail and threats to boycott the CBC. Eye Weekly of Toronto described the show as one of 1995's humorous lowlights. Nonetheless, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the program earned Peters a nomination for a Gemini Award</a> and enhanced his commercial viability.</p><h2 id=a-fascinating-breakthrough>A&nbsp;Fascinating Breakthrough</h2><p>Peters' breakthrough occurred in 2004 when he returned to CTV's Comedy Now! He was nominated for a Gemini Award for the program, but he received greater glory when pirated footage of his acts appeared on YouTube. It catapulted his career to new heights by making him a global viral superstar. Clayton, his brother, became his manager. Peters secured an agreement to produce a sitcom, but networks ultimately declined.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Talk Show Royalty Garage: Inside Ellen DeGeneres' Massive Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=peters-top-of-the-line-performances>Peters' Top-Of-The-Line Performances</h2><p>In 2006, Peters sold out consecutive shows at the Beacon Theater in New York City and taped his first full-length special, Outsourced. It was broadcast on <a href=#>Comedy Central</a> and over 100,000 DVDs were sold. The success of Outsourcing work led to additional performances that broke records. In 2007, Peters was the first comedian to sell out the Air Canada Center in Toronto (now Scotiabank Arena). He released the sold-out Madison Square Garden performance as the self-financed stand-up comedy film Red, White, and Brown. In addition, about 100,000 DVDs were sold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, Peters broke attendance records at the largest comedy gigs in Australia and Singapore. In 2010, he performed to more than 13,000 people at Sydney's Acer Arena, and in 2012, he performed to more than 18,000 people over two nights at the Singapore Indoor Stadium.</p><p>In 2009, Peters gained $10 million and was included among Forbes magazine's top 10 <a href=#>highest-earning comedians</a>. After 2009, he appeared on the list multiple times, culminating at No. 3 in 2013 with $21 million in earnings. His 2015 earnings were reported to be $19 million. "Almost Famous" was the name of Peters' successful and extensive 2014–2016 globe tour, which made reference to his elusive American stardom.</p><h2 id=successful-movie-amp-tv-appearances>Successful Movie & TV Appearances</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2006, Peters relocated to Los Angeles but struggled to make it in Hollywood. He auditioned for a number of film and television projects but turned down those that demanded an artificial Indian accent. Since then, he has acted in such films as the heist drama The Take (2008), Garry Marshall's New Year's Eve (2011), Source Code (2011) shot in Montreal, and Jon Favreau's sleeper smash Chef (2014).</p><p>In short, Russell Peters has many achievements in his bag and as a result, he is regarded as one of the biggest comedians in the world. With his versatile style and charisma, his career has achieved new heights.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>CR7 Real Estate: These Are Most Expensive Homes Owned By Cristiano Ronaldo</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Indian</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1sMOMq6ysq5WhuW68xK2cq6tdl7KkrcyeZKimlWK8p3nToZxmmpmctKa%2F02aaqKWVmbaiutJmoKdlpJ2ybsPOq6OdZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-hailey-bieber-close-to-her-dad-stephen-baldwin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Hailey Bieber Close To Her Dad, Stephen Baldwin?">&larr;
