In 1972, he was announced as the heir apparent to the throne at twenty years and enrolled at the Royal Military College in Canberra, Australia. After completing a corporal liberal arts degree from the University of New South Wales, the prince earned his second Bachelor’s degree in Thailand. Fifty days after King Bhumibol Adulyadej passed away, Vajiralongkorn became the tenth king of the Chakri dynasty to take the throne. In 2019, he became the reigning king in a three-day ceremony. Today, <a href=#>the king holds a marvelous $43 billion net worth</a> and remains one of the wealthiest monarchs in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From a fleet of private jets and helicopters to owning jewelry worth billions, everything owned by Maha Vajiralongkorn is expensive. Let’s take a look inside the riches of the King Of Thailand.</p><h2 id=a-fleet-of-private-aircrafts>A Fleet Of&nbsp;Private Aircrafts</h2><p>The King of Thailand has built up an impressive fleet of aircraft in his collection and keeps adding more aviation vehicles to his disposal. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a>, he owns 38 jets and helicopters exclusively used by the royal family in Thailand. He has three Airbus and four Boeing airlines, three Sukhoi Superjet 100s, four Northrop F5-E fighter jets, and twenty-one helicopters. This fleet's total fuel and maintenance costs come to a whopping $64 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>An Aerial Arsenal: Inside Bill Gates' Aircraft Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=expensive-real-estate>Expensive Real Estate</h2><p>One of the biggest sources of wealth for the King of Thailand comes from the inherited assets acquired from his late father. He is the largest shareholder in two of the country’s biggest commercial properties: Siam Commercial Bank PCL and Siam Cement PCL. The property portfolio also has towering office buildings, luxury shopping malls, and high-end hotels in Bangkok. In the residential area, he lives in a mansion that is reportedly worth $12 million.</p><h2 id=a-massive-car-collection>A Massive Car Collection</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a part of <a href=#>one of the world’s wealthiest families</a>, it is not a surprise that the monarch has a line-up of beautiful cars in his collection. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HotCars</a>, he owns more than one Mercedes-Maybach 62 Limousine. Another Mercedes in his collection is the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W221) which stands out as a distinctive generation in the flagship series by the automaker. The king also has a Rolls-Royce Corniche, a car that is exclusively used by the royal members and has been transformed into a convertible.</p><h2 id=the-royal-boat>The Royal Boat</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the cost of the royal boat remains unknown, it is one of the oldest modes of transportation owned by the Thai Royal Family. After the coronation of Maha Vajiralongkorn, he was aboard the king’s vessel that completed a two-mile route in Bangkok. The Queen, his son, and two daughters accompanied him on the ride. The vessel is called Suphannahong and is designed with 52-gold painted barges carved into mythical creatures and swans.</p><h2 id=some-of-world-s-most-expensive-jewelry>Some Of World’s Most Expensive Jewelry</h2><p>Along with owning jewels that are a part of Thai culture, Maha Vajiralongkorn has an extraordinary piece of jewelry that makes the country stand out from the others. He owns the world’s largest faceted diamond, valued between $4 and $12 million. The 546.67-carat brown diamond is a part of the crown jewels and is called the Golden Jubilee Diamond, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scmp</a>. The diamond is located at the Thai Palace and is always carefully guarded by security.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-frequent-royal-ceremonies-and-parties>The Frequent Royal Ceremonies And Parties</h2><p>Besides being a family man, Maha Vajiralongkorn also likes to spend time with his pets. In 2007, the then-Crown Prince threw a lavish birthday party for his pet dog Fufu, who held a position in the country's military as Air Chief Marshal. Apart from birthdays, the royal ceremonies hosted by him also cost more than a few million. His three-day coronation Buddhist and Brahmin ceremony cost him $30 million.</p><h2 id=an-array-of-expensive-weddings>An Array Of Expensive Weddings</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vajiralongkorn is a man with many marriages and has shared vows with four women until now. He first got married in 1977 to Princess Soamsawali Kitiyakara, who is his cousin. The couple was married for 16 years, and then the king married Thai actress Sujarinee Vivacharawongse but divorced her after two years. He was married to his third wife, Srirasmi Suwadee, for thirteen years until 2014. In 2019, he married Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana a few days before his coronation, and she was proclaimed Queen Suthida after his coronation, as stated by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>. The cost of the <a href=#>wedding was valued in the millions</a>.</p><h2 id=luxury-vacations>Luxury Vacations</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maha Vajiralongkorn spent many years traveling around the world during his youth while he was getting an education. The king is known to travel to Germany quite often, and he took refuge in the same country when the COVID-19 pandemic was raging around the world. The king took a few staff members and booked a luxury hotel in the Alpine region of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany to self-isolate.</p><p>Other notable expenditures include buying commercial properties, 30 poodles, and paying an entourage of 250 people who work for him every day. Maha Vajiralongkorn is a man with expensive tastes who likes to live and travel in luxury everywhere.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 9 Most Expensive Watches In Drake's Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HotCars</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scmp</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8inqqKclWLBqbGMq6CcoJWoerCyjKaYoZldq66rtdGao6iml6C8s7qMpKCnn12ks27Ax5qgpZmemXw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jimmy-kimmel-asks-people-about-wakanda-in-lie-witness-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jimmy Kimmel Asks People About Wakanda In &amp;quot;Lie Witness News&amp;quot;">&larr;
