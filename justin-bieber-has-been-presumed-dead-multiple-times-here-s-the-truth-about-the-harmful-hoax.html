Fans love each batch of new <strong><a href=#>music</a> </strong>he releases. People are in awe of his marriage to Hailey Bieber. And everyone feels awful about his battle with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. But as much as Justin Bieber lives the high life at times, being famous does have its cons. And every once in a while, a Justin Bieber death hoax pops up online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why do people keep writing that Justin Bieber has died? And how many times has this happened to the famous singer? There's a lot to know about the terrible and false rumors about Justin Bieber passing away.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-2023-justin-bieber-death-hoax>What Is The 2023 Justin Bieber Death Hoax?</h2><p>There are several <a href=#>death hoaxes about big stars</a>, and they are all horrible. It's strange to think that people want to spread false news about celebrities. But, unfortunately, this happens on a regular basis.</p><p>In March 2023, Vairal News 93 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber had passed away</a>, and people began searching "Justin Bieber dead" on Twitter.</p><p>According to The Sun, someone tweeted, "USA (RIP) Justin Bieber died after crashing at over 100mph, coroner's report reveals 05.03.2023."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/justin-bieber-performing-onstage.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Sun reported that Snopes commented, "There is no evidence Bieber is dead. If it was true, it would be widely reported and memorialized by reputable publications."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Justin Bieber Didn’t Erase His Selena Gomez Tattoo Even After Falling Deeply For Hailey Bieber</a></span></p><p>Justin Bieber doesn't seem to have commented on the 2023 rumor that he died. But he has mentioned these death hoaxes in the past. In 2010, he tweeted, "one...Im not dead. I had to check on this one...but it turns out Im alive."</p><p>It's always easy to tell when false news is being spread about a celebrity's supposed death. As Snopes noted, if a famous singer like Justin Bieber had tragically and sadly passed away, every single publication would write about it. The news would be everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/justin-and-hailey-bieber-s-secret-home-life-is-both-over-the-top-and-totally-touching.jpg><p>Fake news about celebrity deaths follows similar patterns. The tweets or articles often say that the celebrity has died in a car crash, a plane crash, or perhaps from using substances. This could be because the website or social media account is trying to make the rumor as believable as possible. If they said that a celebrity died from a long illness, for instance, fans would instantly know that this wasn't true.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Justin Bieber Write Any Songs About Women Other Than Selena Gomez And Hailey Bieber?</a></span></p><p>The fact that the words "Justin Bieber dead" have been written online so many times is, of course, a huge problem. It's usually clear that these stories are completely false. But if anyone close to the singer believed them and began to worry, that would be awful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's fair to say that Justin Bieber has become tired of reading these rumors time and time again. It doesn't seem fair that he should have to deal with this. But he doesn't often respond.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber-has-been-presumed-dead-multiple-times>Justin Bieber Has Been Presumed Dead Multiple Times</h2><p>Justin Bieber has been the subject of a fake death hoax for several years now. In fact, rumors about his passing have been spread since 2010. It seems like every few years, fans see another article or tweet saying that he has gotten into a car accident. It's horrible to keep seeing these messages.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Justin Bieber's Father Have Anything To Do With Hailey? The Truth About Jeremy's Mysterious Relationship With His Daughter-In-Law</a></span></p><p>There is one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website that often says Justin Bieber died</a>. According to Yahoo!, the articles are always exactly the same. In 2014, the website justin.bieber.servers.well.com said, "R.I.P. Justin Bieber, died crashing his Ferrari going 125 miles per hour. He is too young to go."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/justin-bieber-looking-serious.jpg><p>In 2016, the website said, "He was killed instantly. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics responding to the vehicle accident and was identified by photo ID found on his body. Alcohol and drugs do not appear to have been a factor in this accident."</p><p>Yahoo! reported that there were five Justin Bieber death hoaxes in 2010. That is definitely too many.</p><p>Although the singer doesn't talk about these rumors much, he has spoken about the downsides of being so famous. And although he loves making music and appreciates his fanbase, his life hasn't been perfect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber talked about the hard times</a> in his life, according to BBC.com, including his 2014 arrests for "driving without due care and attention" and vandalism. While he is happy now being married to Hailey Bieber, he has talked about having mental health struggles in the past.</p><p>The singer wrote, "I made every bad decision you could have thought of and went from one of the most loved and adored people in the world to the most ridiculed, judged and hated person in the world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/justin-bieber.jpg><p>In 2015, Justin Bieber was interviewed by Billboard and said that it was very difficult for him to become a celebrity at such a young age. He said, “I wouldn’t suggest being a child star. It’s the toughest thing in the world.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued to Billboard, “I want people to be more kind to young celebrities."</p><p>While stars are used to reading stories about themselves, death hoaxes take things to a new, terrible level. It must be difficult for Bieber to constantly read these social media posts. When fans Google his name, these tweets often come up. And that's too bad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/justin-and-hailey-bieber-3.jpg><p>In 2018, the singer told CTV News that he didn't want to view himself as a celebrity. He said, "What does that really mean, 'To be famous?' In general, fame can tear you apart, so you can never really feel like you're famous. When people start acting like they're famous, that's when they start losing it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given what Bieber has said in the past about being a well-known figure, he must try his best to ignore the death hoax stories. It's a shame that these rumors continue. Unfortunately, thanks to social media, it seems impossible to stop death hoaxes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrquknrtursiemZ6qXZmyorCMoaaasF2iwq3AyKmjnmWknrqmv4ywn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./oscars-2017-red-carpet-fashion-what-the-stars-wore.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Oscars 2017 Red Carpet Fashion: What the Stars Wore">&larr;
