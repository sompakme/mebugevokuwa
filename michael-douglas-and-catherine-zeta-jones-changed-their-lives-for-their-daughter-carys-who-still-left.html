When those same people have kids, that can be even worse as stars like <a href=#>Heidi Klum are judged for their parenting choices</a>. Worse yet, stars like <a href=#>Owen Wilson who are uninvolved in one of their child's lives</a> get judged even more.</p><p>Unfortunately for Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, they have been judged since <a href=#>their daughter claimed she was traumatized by their fame</a>. Still, Douglas and Zeta-Jones seemed to try to do the best for their daughter since they even moved for her. However, their decision to move seemingly was a mistake since their daughter then quickly departed.</p><h2 id=why-did-michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-39-daughter-carys-leave-them>Why Did Michael Douglas And Catherine Zeta-Jones' Daughter Carys Leave Them?</h2><p>In the year 1999, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones became a couple. Only a year later, the two gorgeous and widely respected actors walked down the aisle and they have remained married ever since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-when-they-were-young.jpg><p>When Douglas and Zeta-Jones first met, <a href=#>their introduction arguably was very creepy</a>. After all, Douglas once revealed during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show that he made a strange remark to Zeta-Jones less than an hour after they met.</p><p>"She came back after her work and we sat there for a little while and I said to her after about half an hour, 'You know, I'm going to be the father of your children.'" Even though Douglas initially thought that comment messed everything up, things obviously worked out.</p><p>Instead, Douglas' remarks became reality not too long after they walked down the aisle. The same year the actors were wed, they welcomed their son Dylan Zeta-Douglas into the world. Three years later, the happy couple had their daughter Carys Zeta-Douglas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/michael-douglas-request-to-have-jodie-foster-as-his-sister-instead-of-daughter-caused-the-actress-to-launch-a-huge-lawsuit-worth-54-5-million.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Michael Douglas' Request To Have Jodie Foster As His Sister Instead Of Daughter In The Game Caused The Actress To Launch A Huge Lawsuit Worth $54.5 Million">Michael Douglas' Request To Have Jodie Foster As His Sister Instead Of Daughter In The Game Caused The Actress To Launch A Huge Lawsuit Worth $54.5 Million</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jodie Foster was promised a major salary for The Game, but things took a turn once Michael Douglas entered the picture.</p><p>In 2019, Douglas spoke to Closer Weekly about the living situation he and Zeta-Jones had with their daughter. As Douglas explained at that time, his daughter Carys Zeta-Douglas had moved out of his home to begin attending boarding school.</p><p>Over the years, it has become known that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">several celebrities have sent their children to boarding school</a>. Some stars who sent their kids to boarding school include Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, Pamela Anderson, Madonna, Jimmy Carter, Steve Jobs, and Cynthia Nixon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-family-photo.jpg><p>As that list makes clear, a wide array of celebrities believed sending their kids to boarding school was the best option. When it comes to Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, however, they weren't the ones who wanted their daughter to leave their home for school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Douglas explained to Closer Weekly, it was his daughter Carys Zeta-Douglas who decided that she wanted to go to boarding school.

She really wanted to take off. It was unexpected because we actually moved to be five minutes from the school that she’d been going to after having had a 45 minute drive and she was really happy. And then all of a sudden this moment came, so we go what are we going to do now?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/michael-douglas-and-carys-zeta-douglas.jpg><p>On the bright side, Douglas went on to explain that it didn't take too long for him and Zeta-Jones to see the bright side of the situation.

So we’re taking full advantage of that, seeing a lot of shows and traveling a lot.”</p><h2 id=who-is-michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-39-daughter-carys-zeta-douglas>Who Is Michael Douglas And Catherine Zeta-Jones' Daughter Carys Zeta-Douglas?</h2><p>In 2018, Town & Country published an issue that featured Catherine Zeta-Jones and her daughter Carys Zeta-Douglas on the cover. In the pages of that issue, Zeta-Douglas was quoted talking about a subject that many nepo babies have discussed in the past.

I think what bothers me the most is that people think I don’t work hard for it, that I don’t need to work hard for it. That anything I do gets handed to me. When, honestly, I feel like it’s the opposite. I feel I need to constantly prove myself to people—that I am not just my parents’ daughter.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-changed-their-lives-for-their-daughter-carys-zeta-douglas-who-still-left-them-anyway.jpg><p>While some celebrity kids talking like that annoys people, Town & Country's article about Zeta-Douglas makes her seem different. According to what Town & Country's writer wrote about Zeta-Douglas, she already was an impressive person by the time she turned fifteen years old.</p><p>"For Carys, tuning out such noise means tuning into her interests, which include, predictably, acting (she has been in school productions of Tommy and Spring Awakening, and she played the lead in Once on This Island) and music (she plays the piano—well). She dreams of an Ivy League education and ponders being a doctor."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carys-zeta-douglas-photoshoot-with-a-guitar.jpg><p>After revealing that Zeta-Douglas loves acting like her parents, Town & Country's article continued to outline what made her impressive at that time. "And, really, how many 15-year-olds authoritatively discuss Italian cinematography or read biographies of the maharaja of Jaipur? Carys does, all while building toward becoming a presence in her own right."</p><p>In 2023, Grazia Daily published an updated article looking at who Zeta-Douglas had become by then. As that article revealed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zeta-Douglas graduated from high school in 2022</a> and has gone on to higher education. However, at this time it is unclear where Zeta-Douglas chose to further her education after high school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYlrKtecOorKCkkah6pK3ToZyroZ6aerux05pko6eemsBuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZq6irJhisaLBxqGrnqpdmK6zxdJmpKiulZl6osPAsmY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./randy-mcnally-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Randy Mcnally Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr;
