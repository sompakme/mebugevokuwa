Yup, all of that happened in less than a year, even fans were struggling to keep up with this Kardashian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>Just 72 days after marrying Kris, Kim decided she wasn’t connected to the relationship and wanted out, and that was despite Kris saying that he was willing to do whatever it took to keep his marriage together. It appeared the mother-of-four had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other plans in mind</a> after having reportedly made millions from publicizing her romance with Kris from beginning to end.</p><p class=p1>When Kris proposed to Kim in May 2011, fans were able to watch the moment it happened on the family’s reality show, ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians,’ only to find out later on that the proposal scene was reshot because the camera crew wasn’t there when Humphries first popped the question.</p><p class=p1>But because we know the Kardashians are all about keeping the ratings, a camera team was called over to Kim’s Beverly Hills mansion so that she could reenact her initial reaction to finding out Kris had popped the question. But what else is there to know about this former couple’s relationship that appears to have gone under the radar?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-dated-after-kim-s-split-with-gabriel-aubry><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Dated After Kim's Split With Gabriel Aubry</span></h2><p>Most fans don’t remember that Kim Kardashian was seeing Halle Berry’s ex, Gabriel Aubry, before she got with NBA star, Kris Humphries. Her romance with the model only lasted a couple of months before they agreed to call it quits. The KKW founder started filming ‘Kourtney & Kim Take New York,’ where she would later be&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">introduced to Kris</a>&nbsp;around November 2010.</p><h2 id=they-went-public-at-a-prince-concert><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Went Public At A Prince Concert</span></h2><p>Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries didn’t go public with their relationship until February 2011 when they were seen hand-in-hand at a Prince concert in Manhattan. The reality TV star was all smiles as she posed for photographs with her new man by her side, who would later star in 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians.'</p><h2 id=he-proposed-in-may-2011><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Proposed In May 2011</span></h2><p>Just three months after Kim and Kris were seen together in public for the first time, it was reported that the athlete had gotten on one knee and proposed at Kim’s Beverly Hills home. The 35-year-old had the words “Will You Marry Me?” written in rose petals as Kim walked into her bedroom to an unbelievable surprise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These ‘KUWTK’ Storylines Would’ve Been Boring Without Kourtney Kardashian</a></span></p><h2 id=the-proposal-was-reshot-for-reality-tv><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Proposal Was ‘Reshot’ For Reality-TV</span></h2><p>Remember seeing Kim’s shock at finding Kris on one knee at her mansion? Well, that was one of many retakes for the family’s reality show, ‘Keeping Up With the Kardashians,’ because the camera crew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t there to film</a> the big moment when it first happened. So, of course, they had to recreate the moment when Kim got engaged, all for the sake of our entertainment... and ratings, of course.</p><h2 id=they-were-only-engaged-for-three-months><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Were Only Engaged For Three Months</span></h2><p>After another three months, Kim Kardashian walked down the aisle and married the man she vowed to love for the rest of her life, which was obviously a lie given how fast the marriage ended, but it was a special moment for Kim nonetheless. After all, she earned a substantial amount from the star-studded event held at an estate in Montecito, California.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-landed-a-lucrative-wedding-special-on-e><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Landed A Lucrative Wedding Special On E!</span></h2><p>Aside from reportedly earning $1.5 million for selling their exclusive&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wedding photos</a> to People magazine, Kim Kardashian and her mother, Kris Jenner, negotiated a lucrative deal for E! Entertainment to obtain the rights to film the couple’s big day for a two-part series, “Kim’s Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event,” on their network. Rumor has it that those numbers were above $10 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Pics Show How Much Kylie Jenner’s Changed Since Season 1 Of KUWTK</a></span></p><h2 id=they-divorced-after-72-days><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Divorced After 72 Days</span></h2><p>In October 2011, just 72 days after tying the knot, Kim Kardashian filed for divorce from Kris Humphries, citing “irreconcilable differences,” while also listing their separation day on the 31st of that month.</p><p>In response to Kim’s shock divorce filing, Kris, who was oblivious by the situation, issued a statement, saying: “I love my wife and am devastated to learn she filed for divorce. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make it work." The couple has a prenup, making it seem that it would be a quick and easy divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-reportedly-made-millions-from-the-marriage><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kim Reportedly Made Millions From The Marriage</span></h2><p>As news of their divorce spread like wildfire in the press and on the internet, several sources came forward to allege that Kim made more than $15 million during the time she was with Kris. From his statement alone, the basketball star was hoping to work things out with Kim, but it appeared that she had no interest in moving forward with her then-husband.</p><h2 id=she-defended-her-reasons-for-divorcing-kris><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She Defended Her Reasons For Divorcing Kris</span></h2><p>Just a day after shocking her fans with her decision to divorce Kris Humphries, Kim wrote a blog post on her official website to defend her actions, insisting that she “got caught up with the hoopla. … I felt like I was on a fast roller coaster and couldn't get off when now I know I probably should have."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We All Forgot About Kris Jenner’s (Failed) Talk Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kris-reportedly-claimed-kim-cheated-with-kanye><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kris Reportedly Claimed Kim Cheated With Kanye</span></h2><p>In June 2012, according to TMZ, Kris had told his then-girlfriend, Myla Sinanaj, that he knew Kim had&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">allegedly been cheating</a> on him with Kanye West&nbsp;while married to the basketball player. Just months after his divorce with Kim, the couple went public with their relationship, but it didn’t surprise Kris one bit because he was already aware that the TV star had intentions of getting with Kanye.</p><h2 id=kris-dealt-with-depression-after-their-split><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kris Dealt With Depression After Their Split</span></h2><p>After cutting ties with the Kardashians for good, Kris Humphries said that the entire situation had left him in a “dark place” after feeling embarrassment and shame over how things ended with Kim. In an essay for The Players’ Tribune, he confessed: "I’ll be honest, I dealt with a lot of anxiety, especially in crowds. There was about a year where I was in a dark place. I didn’t want to leave my home.”</p><p>”You feel like … I don’t know … the whole world hates you, but they don’t even know why. They don’t even know you at all.
