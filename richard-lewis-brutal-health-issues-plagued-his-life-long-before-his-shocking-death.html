Throughout his life, <strong>Richard Lewis suffered from numerous illnesses and conditions</strong>. First and foremost was the 2023 revelation that he was <strong>diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease</strong>. However, in Lewis' Tweet, he claimed that this diagnosis occurred two years prior to him going public with it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I went to a neurologist and they gave me a brain scan and I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and that was about two years ago."</p><p>According to People, Lewis continued by saying, "But luckily I got it late in life and they say you progress very slowly if at all and I'm on the right meds so I'm cool."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar41942161-1.jpg><p>Following the Season 12 premiere of HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm, Richard Lewis publicly explained why he was not in attendance.</p><p>“I have some occasional walking difficulties with Parkinson's the last couple of years. It's not major. I'm getting through it fine so far, but I didn't want to go to, spend five or six hours mingling with so many people."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Richard Lewis was well enough to film multiple episodes for Curb Your Enthusaism's twelfth and final season, he almost missed the eleventh season entirely.

This was related to acute back pain, according to Today. He also shattered his shoulder in 2020. And back in 2016, he shattered his right hand after he fell from his roof. Due to the lengthy recovery process, Lewis announced that he wasn't going to be able to join Larry David and the cast of Curb Your Enthusiasm for Season 11. Fortunately, he garnered enough strength to return for a single episode. Come season 12, Lewis was capable of filming multiple episodes. But that didn't mean he was in the clear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/richard-lewis-smiling.jpg><p>During a Vanity Fair interview published mere weeks before his 2024 death, Richard <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lewis explained how all-encompassing his diagnosis was</a>.</p><p>"I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s a couple of years ago.

This is when he believed that his life would end due to his dependency on it. Following this point, he had no choice but to turn his life around. Without a doubt, <strong>Lewis triumphed over his battle with addiction </strong>and was almost <strong>30 years sober</strong> when he passed away in 2024. This also included abstinence from substances, which he also partook in during his years as a stand-up comedian. Lewis also claimed he was taking serious drugs prior to getting sober.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/curb-your-enthusiasm-here-s-what-richard-lewis.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Richard Lewis covered his battle with addiction thoroughly in his memoir, "The Other Great Depression". But in a 2015 interview with Klean Radio, Lewis claimed that his sobriety was often "minute to minute". And in the first few years of his sobriety, his sex addiction kicked in. After he beat that, he claimed to have had an eating disorder.</p><p>"I wasn't drinking or using but my life was still unmanageable, so it's taken me a while. Stopping -- I would have died had I not stopped. Crystal meth was the last drug I took, and it brought me to my knees, but then all these defects I had, of character, you know, womanizing, and sex addiction, and eating disorders, and all of that, those were flaming because I wasn't drinking or medicating myself with the regular stuff."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar49659466-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Larry David's Parking Lot Meltdown Feels Like It Was Taken Straight Out Of Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Larry David once freaked out the way his Curb Your Enthusiasm character would because he couldn't get out of a parking lot.</span><p>Richard Lewis claimed that he was able to gain control over all of these things by trying to be "a better man".</p><p>"I think I'm more at peace than I've ever been in my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-illness-did-richard-lewis-have-that-caused-his-death>What Illness Did Richard Lewis Have That Caused His Death?</h2><p>According to CBC, Richard Lewis told his fans in 2023 that he had been <strong>diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease</strong>. But it was <strong>a heart attack in his home on February 28th, 2024</strong> that ultimately claimed his life. At the time of this writing, little else is known about the circumstances surrounding the untimely demise of the beloved 76-year-old man. However, there is a lot of literature that shows the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">correlation between Parkinson's Disease and an increased rate of heart problems</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/instar40606938-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the American Parkinson's Disease Association, the illness causes far more than movement issues. Parkinson's Disease can have a severe impact on the cardiac system as well as the major and minor blood vessels that surround it. This means those who have the disease are at a higher risk of having a significant heart event. So, while little is known about the specific details of Richard Lewis' death, it appears there may have been a link between his Parkinson's Disease and his death. But one cannot confirm that at this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopuYlr%2BlecuerqKrXZ2yorjToWSiq6OqsrR5z6WYoK2VmXqttcWeZKWnnpx6o7HFqKmeZaOdvKS3yKeeZpyVlsGpew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-top-10-most-unexpected-luxurious-holiday-destinations-in-the-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Top 10 Most Unexpected Luxurious Holiday Destinations In The World">&larr;
