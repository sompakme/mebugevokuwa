Recently, Ryan, his wife <strong><a href=#>Blake Lively</a></strong>, Hugh Jackman, and, well, of course, Taylor Swift, were all hanging out at a Kansas City Chiefs football game cheering on Travis Kelce. So, now there's this idea floating around that Taylor Swift is indeed teaming up with Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool 3, and fans are loving the thought of him and Taylor Swift sharing the screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-would-taylor-swift-fit-into-the-mcu-with-ryan-reynolds>How Would Taylor Swift Fit Into The MCU With Ryan Reynolds?</h2><p>Is Taylor Swift joining the MCU? The whole thing is adding an extra layer of excitement to the Deadpool 3 story. It's like a surprise guest in a movie you're already super excited about seeing. Hollywood can be a bit crazy with rumors, but if Taylor Swift jumps into the MCU with Deadpool, it's going to be an even bigger blockbuster than it's already anticipated to be.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/c356d741e9046b477721e5787f628cbd-2-1.jpg><p>Taylor Swift hasn't done much acting; she has been in a few flicks that were not her own, though.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Movies with Taylor Swift</p></th><th scope=col><p>Character</p></th><th scope=col><p>Year</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Valentine's Day</p></td><td><p>Felicia</p></td><td><p>2010</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Lorax</p></td><td><p>Voice of Audrey</p></td><td><p>2012</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The Giver</p></td><td><p>Rosemary</p></td><td><p>2014</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cats</p></td><td><p>Bombalurina</p></td><td><p>2019</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Amsterdam</p></td><td><p>Elizabeth Meekins</p></td><td><p>2022</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The role TSwift would hypothetically play is that of Dazzler. According to Marvel.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dazzler, whose real name is Alison Blaire, is a mutant</a> with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams. She is also a talented singer and performer, making her a perfect fit for Taylor Swift's musical background.

Taylor <a href=#>Swift is responsible for Blake Lively's directorial debut </a>as well. She had her direct a music video for her because she knew how much the Gossip Girl wanted to try out the profession.</p><p><a href=#>Taylor also mentioned Ryan Reynolds and Blake Livley's daughters, James, Inez, and Betty, on her Folklore album</a>, and Swift is extremely close with the family. She even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave a special shoutout to Ryan Reynolds and Blake's daughters, James and Inez</a>, at her Philadelphia Era's Tour concert. They refer to her as Aunt Taylor.</p><p>Anyway, Ryan Reynolds took a moment to tackle the swirling rumors about Swift's potential cameo in Deadpool 3 in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. The speculation was sparked when it was noticed that Swift used the same location for All Too Well: The Short Film that Reynolds had chosen when announcing Hugh Jackman's casting in Deadpool 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Spirited actor went on to cancel the rumors of Taylor Swift joining him in Deadpool 3. (Maybe he just has to say that, though?) At any rate, he said in the same interview, "Of course, she would be welcome in it. Are you kidding me? I would do anything for that woman. She's a genius." Reynolds went on to say the entire family is obsessed with her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/taylor-swift-and-shawn-levy.jpg><p>However, according to Screen Rant, director Shawn Levy has yet to deny that Taylor Swift will be in the movie, even if it is ever-so-brief. And the two were recently spotted hanging out in New York City together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Confirmed Actors In Deadpool 3</p></th><th scope=col><p>Character</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Hugh Jackman</p></td><td><p>Wolverine</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Owen Wilson</p></td><td><p>Mobius M.

After nearly two decades away from the character, the actress is making a comeback as Marvel Comics' assassin antiheroine for Deadpool 3.</p><p>The actress is very close friends with Ryan Reynolds, and he has been campaigning for her return to the MCU for quite some time. Garner portrayed Elektra in the 2003 Daredevil movie and then got her own movie in 2004. Unfortunately, it did not get the best reviews, but Reynolds believes in her talent and is excited to see her bring the character back to life. Notably, Hugh Jackman has also emerged from Marvel's retirement for the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-else-ryan-reynolds-could-want-from-taylor-swift>What Else Ryan Reynolds Could Want From Taylor Swift</h2><p>Ryan Reynolds and his friend and co-owner of the Welsh football club Wrexham A.F.C., Rob McElhenney (known for his role of Mac in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia), are aiming for greatness not only on the field at Wrexham but outside the world of sports as well. Like, say, having concerts at the stadium.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/despite-the-success-of-the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-wasn-t-immune-to-forgetting-the-lyrics-of-her-songs.jpg><p>You guessed it, she may not be moving to the Marvel beat, but Ryan Reynolds would love for Taylor Swift to do her thing at the Racecourse Ground Stadium. Back in May, Reynolds hinted at the exciting prospect of having Swift, or perhaps even <strong><a href=#>Beyoncé</a></strong>, perform at the Racecourse. During an interview on the Fearless in Devotion podcast, he shared that both he and McElhenney would be thrilled to have high-profile performers grace their grounds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYr%2Bmxc2oo52rXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwW65wKutnqRdqruqwsSrqp5llJqupbzOqKNma12ZrrvGy56paA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-10-most-annoying-traits-your-girlfriend-can-have.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 Most Annoying Traits Your Girlfriend Can Have">&larr;
