In classic Swift style, the country song is about having to break up with a man you love after realizing you deserve better.</p><p><span>“I know I’m probably better off on my own / Than lovin’ a man who didn’t know / What he had when he had it,” the lyrics begin. “And I see the permanent damage you did to me / Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic / I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror / Saying to myself, you know you had to do it / I know the bravest thing I ever did was run.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/taylor-swift-49883012-1829-4ceb-a435-ae97052f3bfd.jpg><p><span>Little Big Town revealed that Swift wrote the song prior to releasing the music video for the new single on Tuesday, November 1.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>“Some of you have been asking and we told you that there was a young girl in Nashville that wrote it by herself, and it’s Taylor Swift,” singer </span><b>Karen Fairchild</b><span> revealed via a Facebook Live video. “She sent us this song and it was one that was really special to her, and she thought of us because of the harmonies. She’s never pitched the song to anyone before and the moment that we heard it we were like, ‘Man, that is a song that we’re going to cut.’”</span></p><p><span>The song is special to Swift seemingly because of her current love life. The singer — who is famous for her breakup ballads — started dating actor </span><b>Tom Hiddleston </b><span>just two weeks after she split from DJ </span><b>Calvin Harris</b><span> in June. The Grammy winner’s whirlwind romance with the</span><i> Thor </i><span>actor caused a media frenzy and sparked an online feud between Swift and her ex Harris after she was photographed kissing the actor soon after parting ways with the DJ.</span></p><p>Despite putting their love on display all over the globe — the high-profile pair ventured from Rhode Island to Nashville and even Rome and his native U.K. while together — Hiddleston and Swift called it quits just three months later in September.</p><p>“She was the one to put the brakes on the relationship,” a source close to the couple told <i>Us</i> at the time. “Tom wanted the relationship to be more public than she was comfortable with. Taylor knew the backlash that comes with public displays of affection, but Tom didn’t listen to her concerns when she brought them up.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/little-big-town-taylor-swift-524da3d5-8aa5-40ab-8343-b7649eb9e3ac.jpg><p><span>Swift also took to social media on Tuesday to reveal that she penned the new song.</span></p><p>“Feeling really honored that a band I’ve loved for so many years decided to record this song I wrote,” she wrote on Instagram. “Good luck at the #cmaawards @littlebigtown !!”</p><p>Little Big Town’s new jam contains hints of both of Swift’s most recent relationships.
