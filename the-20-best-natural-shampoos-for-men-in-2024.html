Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>Reviewed by<strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Dr. Diana Rangaves, PharmD</a></strong></p><p>The hair care industry is booming, with new products introduced daily. However, not all hair care products are created equal; some may be better for your hair and scalp than others. One type of hair care product that has gained popularity in recent years is natural shampoo.</p><p>Natural shampoos are made from natural and organic ingredients, and are free from harsh chemicals and synthetic fragrances. In this article, we will explore why it is important to choose natural shampoos, and discuss the benefits that they offer. We will also review some of the best natural shampoos specifically targeted at men’s hair care needs.</p><h2><strong>Why You Should Opt for Natural Shampoos</strong></h2><h3><strong>Natural Shampoos are Gentle on the Hair and Scalp</strong></h3><p>Conventional shampoos often contain harsh detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS). These detergents strip the hair of its natural oils and cause damage to the scalp. On the other hand, natural shampoos are formulated with gentle, plant-based ingredients that clean the hair without stripping it of its natural oils. This can help to reduce dryness, breakage, and irritation, and leave the hair feeling softer and more manageable.</p><h3><strong>Natural Shampoos are Free from Harsh Chemicals</strong></h3><p>Many conventional shampoos contain harsh chemicals such as parabens, phthalates, and synthetic fragrances. These chemicals are linked to a range of health concerns, including hormone disruption, allergies, and cancer. Natural shampoos are free from these harsh chemicals. Instead, they are often made with ingredients that are known to be safe and beneficial for the hair and scalp.</p><h3><strong>Natural Shampoos are Better for the Environment</strong></h3><p>There are many shampoos that contain chemicals that are pretty harmful to the environment, like sulfates and synthetic fragrances. These chemicals pollute waterways, harm wildlife, and contribute to environmental degradation. Most natural shampoos are made with natural and organic ingredients that are biodegradable and sustainable. Natural hair care brands go out of their way to ensure that their packaging is environmentally friendly.</p><h3><strong>Natural Shampoos Promote Healthy Hair Growth</strong></h3><p>Many natural shampoos contain ingredients that are known to promote healthy hair growth, such as biotin, rosemary oil, and peppermint oil. These ingredients can help to stimulate the scalp, improve blood circulation, and nourish the hair follicles, leading to stronger, healthier hair over time.</p><h3><strong>Natural Shampoos are Beneficial for People With Sensitive Skin</strong></h3><p>People with sensitive skin may find that conventional shampoos cause irritation and itching, due to the harsh chemicals that they contain. However, natural shampoos are often formulated with gentle, non-irritating ingredients that are less likely to cause allergic reactions or skin irritation.</p><h2><strong>Top 20 Natural Shampoos for Men&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In today’s world, people are increasingly conscious of the products they use on their bodies, including the products they use to clean and care for their hair. Natural shampoos are an excellent alternative to traditional chemical-laden shampoos, as they are made from natural ingredients that are gentle on the hair and scalp.</p><p>We compiled a comprehensive guide of the best 20 natural shampoos for men, taking into account factors such as ingredients, effectiveness, and men’s hair needs. Whether you have dry, oily, or normal hair, our selection includes a variety of shampoos to suit different hair types and needs. With our guide, you can make an informed decision and choose a natural shampoo that cleanses your hair, and nourishing it with natural ingredients, leaving you with healthy and shiny locks.
