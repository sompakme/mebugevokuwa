Not a blockbuster (this movie grossed only $32.2 million in the United States), Silverado still won positive reviews for its all-star cast and action-packed gunfight sequences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gunslinger Malachi "Mall" Johnson, played by Danny Glover, is one of the four caught up in a conflict between the sheriff of Silverado and a callous rancher. Glover approached the film and role with sensitivity and gravitas, alongside heavyweights in the film's cast.</p><h2 id=places-in-the-heart-1984---34-9-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Places In The Heart (1984) - $34.9 Million</span></h2><p>Danny Glover earned his only Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, playing a role in the drama film Places In The Heart (1984), set in 1930s Texas. Although its box office earnings were relatively low at $34.9 million, the movie was well-received by critics, especially with respect to Glover's performance.</p><p>In the film, he portrays Moze, a poverty-stricken Black farm hand who assists a widow (played by Sally Field) tending to her land following the demise of her husband. Subtly but effectively, Glover's portrayal emphasized the trauma of segregation experienced and the resolve that sustained Moze in a Depression-era Texas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angels-in-the-outfield-1994---50-2-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Angels In The Outfield (1994) - $50.2 Million</span></h2><p>Angels In The Outfield – a comedy fantasy film starring Danny Glover as manager George Knox, released in 1994 – grossed $50.2 million in the United States.</p><p>It was not a smash hit, but it enchanted viewers with its story of angels helping a struggling team. Glover gave a convivial and heartwarming performance in this family film.</p><p>His comic acting was notable in scenes depicting his character's argument with an angel who gave advice. The role was not enough to define his career, but Angels In The Outfield demonstrated Glover's range and appeal to audiences of all ages.</p><h2 id=predator-2-1990---57-1-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Predator 2 (1990) - $57.1 Million</span></h2><p>Danny Glover played Lieutenant Mike Harrigan, who faced up against the fearsome Predator alien hunter in Los Angeles in Predator 2.</p><p>It was a moderate hit, grossing $57.1 million at the movie office. With his robust and gritty portrayal, Glover took over the action hero position from Arnold Schwarzenegger in the first film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though not as memorable as the original Predator, Glover's moments of scheming and combating the alien demonstrated his ability to handle an exceptional effects-heavy sci-fi thriller. It also demonstrated his ability to direct a compelling action franchise.</p><h2 id=the-royal-tenenbaums-2001---71-4-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) - $71.4 Million</span></h2><p>Despite not playing the lead role of "Royal Tenenbaum," Danny Glover delivered a standout supporting performance in Wes Anderson's 2001 family-disordered comedy-drama The Royal Tenenbaums.</p><p>The movie brought in $71.4 million at the box office, thanks to its unusual characters and quirky humor. Glover complemented actors Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston – as the family friend Henry Sherman – with warmth and subdued humor. Through his performance, he demonstrated his versatility in independent films, and his capacity to excel – in even supporting roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=saw-2004---103-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Saw (2004) - $103.Million</span></h2><p>The 2004 horror thriller Saw, starring Danny Glover as Detective David Tapp, was a sleeper hit, grossing over $103 million on a small budget. As the obsessed detective trying to catch the Jigsaw serial killer, Glover brought gravitas and intensity to the gory indie film.</p><p>His performance as a man spiraling into darkness and his willingness to star in a visceral horror movie again showed his range. Though very different from his most famous roles, Glover's supporting turn in Saw helped launch the profitable torture centric franchise; Glover further demonstrated he could draw audiences, even through R-rated scary movies.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Josh-Hartnett-Wearing-Black-Glasses.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Highest-Grossing Josh Hartnett Films, Ranked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Josh Hartnett has more than a few box office hits to his name.</span><h2 id=lethal-weapon-1987---120-2-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Lethal Weapon (1987) - $120.2 Million</span></h2><p>The smash action hit Lethal Weapon, starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as an offbeat duo of Los Angeles police detectives and released in 1987, generated over $120 million worldwide.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Glover provided the grounded counterbalance to Gibson's intensity in partnering with veteran detective Roger Murtaugh – who seemed frustrated by pairing with the reckless Martin Riggs in Glover. This opposed-but-bound chemistry struck a chord with audiences, and it became the central theme of the Lethal Weapon series.</p><h2 id=the-color-purple-1985---142-6-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Color Purple (1985) - $142.6 Million</span></h2><p>The Color Purple – a Steven Spielberg drama, released in 1985 and featuring Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg – grossed $142 million internationally.</p><p>In the role of Mister (Goldberg's character Celie's abusive husband) Glover delivered a terrifying performance and proved his ability to play a truly bad guy. He could be very severe and grave, and his anger and cruelty toward Celie made him dislikable to audiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Glover's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ability to showcase his talents in darker roles</a> became evident as he began playing unlikable characters, displaying his versatility. This in turn marked his dramatic breakthrough.</p><h2 id=dreamgirls-2006---154-9-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Dreamgirls (2006) - $154.9 Million</span></h2><p>The 2006 musical drama Dreamgirls grossed more than $150 million worldwide, successful in large part due to Danny Glover's appearance as manager Marty Madison.</p><p>Though not the leading actor, Glover shone in an ensemble cast which included names such as <a href=#>Beyoncé</a>, Jennifer Hudson, and Eddie Murphy. Glover brought an edge, sharpness, and a touch of humor as the wise and sophisticated manager of an upcoming Motown girl group during the 1960s.</p><p>In a major motion picture with stars and songs, Glover once again established himself as a noteworthy artist.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/19652740876_20804ed5e2_o1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Highest-Grossing Films Produced By Kathleen Kennedy, Ranked</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Kathleen Kennedy has proven to be one of Hollywood's most successful producers over the years.</span><h2 id=maverick-1994---183-1-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Maverick (1994) - $183.1 Million</span></h2><p>Danny Glover's biggest box office smash was the 1994 western comedy Maverick, which grossed over $180 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In it, Glover portrayed the opponent to Mel Gibson's Bret Maverick and Jodie Foster's Annabelle Bransford, as bank robber Billy Zane. Glover was at ease in the humorous western, playing Zane with charisma and humor even as he menaced the protagonists.</p><p>Glover also exhibited his knack for physical comedy and banter in Maverick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnbK0wIygqairo567qHnDmqWnsV2cubDCxKtkpqemnrK0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10-keanu-reeves-memes-that-are-too-hilarious-for-words.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Keanu Reeves Memes That Are Too Hilarious For Words">&larr;
