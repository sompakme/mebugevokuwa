On Sunday night, part three will air. The ten-part docu-series is a deep dive into the career of Chicago Bulls legend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a>.

The documentary toggles between important moments in Jordan's career and the tumultuous '97-98 season.</p><h2 id=what-to-expect><strong>What To Expect</strong></h2><p>On April 19th, Parts 1&2 were released. They chronicled the early years of Michael Jordan. Starting from his days playing in college at North Carolina and his first few years in the NBA. It also sets the stage for the drama leading up to the start of the 1997 season. Bulls then-general manager Jerry Krause had made it known that this would be Phil Jackson's final season as the coach and he fully intended on blowing up the team and rebuilding at the end of the year. In response, Jordan stated that if Jackson wasn't welcome to return, then neither would he. With the end of the road nearing, as the Bulls mounted up to defend their title, Jackson nicknamed the season 'The Last Dance.'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What 'The Last Dance' Has Revealed About Dennis Rodman</a></span></p><p>On April 26th, Parts 3&4 were released. These two episodes focussed heavily on the Bulls rivalry with the Detroit Pistons. The "Bad Boy" Pistons stymied a young Bulls team for two straight years before the Bulls finally broke through en route to their first title in 1991. Dennis Rodman connects the two teams. The relentless defender and rebounder began his career with the Pistons and later, helped the Bulls achieve their second three-peat.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Sunday night</a>, at 9 p.m. ET, part five will air. One hour later, part six will air. Here is what to expect from this week's episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A short clip released earlier this week hint at what viewers can expect to see this weekend. In the clip that is not more than a minute long, it shows various commercials MJ was in as he became a global icon. This week will most likely go into companies such as Gatorade and Nike, who buily brands around Jordan. It seems as if this week's instalments will focus on the celebrity of Jordan that took off during the first three title runs. Michael Jordan became "must-see" and he made fans out of everyone, everywhere.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking Back At Kobe Bryant's Most Difficult Matchups</a></span></p><p>The clip also shows the late Kobe Bryant. Their paths crossed toward's the end of Jordan's career and in the infant stages of Bryant's. In the first trailer for&nbsp;The Last Dance,&nbsp;it appears that Kobe sat down for an interview during the making of this documentary. If we do in fact see him on Sunday, it will be the first new Kobe content since his death in January.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of what is and isn't in this week's episodes, it is must-watch television. While we are lacking live sports, this is the closest thing to it.&nbsp;The Last Dance&nbsp;serves many purposes. For some, it is simply something to watch in the absence of anything else. For others, it will be received with the nostalgia of a time gone by. It is an education for the younger generations, who never saw Jordan play and have only heard stories of his greatness.</p><p>The Last Dance,&nbsp;directed by Jason Hehir airs Sunday, April 3rd, at 9 p.m ET on ESPN.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What NBA Stars Are Saying About ESPN's New Michael Jordan Documentary&nbsp;</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1doa60wIydmKeblWLEqa3TZquoZZWtvaav02adq6edYsSmscpmamg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./12-rich-people-that-were-let-off-way-too-easy.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="12 Rich People That Were Let Off Way Too Easy">&larr;
