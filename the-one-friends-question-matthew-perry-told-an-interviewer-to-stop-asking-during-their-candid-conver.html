The interview took place back in 2016, a few years before the Friends reunion would actually take place. However, during this particular discussion, Perry was talking about his playwriting debut in, The End of Longing.</p><p>Though as was the case throughout his career, the interview turned into rapid fire questions related to his time on Friends. At this point, Friends was starting to resurface given that rumors of a possible reunion were starting to circulate. The interviewer was full of questions surrounding the speculation.</p><p>She asks, "We got this carrot dangled in the front of us that there was a reunion. It got pitched as a reunion, so everyone was like it could happen. Is it completely written off? If you would go back, would you want to have some sort of control as to where your character would be?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Credit to Perry who did answer the questions, stating that there wasn't any reunion taking place. In addition, he did reveal that he would love to have control over Chandler's future. However, that was the last of the information he would be willing to give out, saying, "Stop asking me questions about the Friends reunion."</p><p>To Perry's credit, he said the line with a smile on his face. The interviewer got the message and moved on from the topic. The moment can be seen in the video below around the 6:10 mark.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Matthew Perry Revealed The Emergency Surgery That Caused Him To Be Out Of Character During The Friends Reunion</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, a reunion did take place, and it caused a huge reaction from Friends fans.

That was the end of the night. You just sat with the person all night long and that was it."</p><p>He continued, "You apologized to the people you were with, but they had to understand you had met somebody special to you and you were going to talk to that person for the rest of the night. And that’s the way it worked. It’s certainly the way it worked with all of us. It’s just the way it is."</p><p>Perry will be missed by millions of fans, and that's especially true for his fellow cast members.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqyknbK4ec%2BeqauxXam8rbCMmqVmoZ6psrPCyJ6unqpdqbxuv9Oop2aZo6C2r7OMqqyeq6SevK%2B%2FjJqZqK2kYrOztcSnm6xloprCr7XOp2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-carolyn-manno-details-of-nbc-sports-journalist-sought-by-netizens-as-the-olympic-apology-cas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Carolyn Manno?
