With the massive success she was able to achieve, it’s not surprising that her career was suddenly derailed by temptation and partying.</p><p>Unfortunately for the actress, her party girl lifestyle began to cause problems for her career. Soon, her personal endeavors overshadowed her rising career. Everyone who has access to the internet knows that Lindsay Lohan had a very public meltdown during the peak of her career.</p><p>She even <a href=#>earned a bad reputation on the set </a>of her films. Luckily, the industry gave her another chance to redeem herself. Lohan is currently starring in a three part film by Netflix, the first installment of the film kicked off just last month.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Lindsay Lohan Got Banned From Château Marmont After Accumulating $46,350 Of Debt At The Hotel">Lindsay Lohan Got Banned From Château Marmont After Accumulating $46,350 Of Debt At The Hotel</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although this is not the first film the actress has ever done, she experienced working with an acting coach for the first time, when she worked with Bernard Hiller while filming her comeback film. With about sixty films under her belt, she has never worked with an acting coach and the reason is pretty simple.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-had-a-much-needed-time-away-from-the-limelight>Lindsay Lohan Had A Much-Needed Time Away From The Limelight</h2><p>The highly publicized meltdown of the famous child star pretty much headlined tabloids for years. Most of millenials and older Gen Zs saw her rise and fall in the entertainment industry. After years of misconduct and numerous troubles with the law, it’s safe to assume that Lohan is aware that she needs help.</p><p>She has checked in on several rehab centers hoping to redeem herself. Despite spending months and thousands on rehab, she is not getting better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Critics Didn't Fall For Lindsay Lohan's Falling For Christmas, And Fans Are Divided">Critics Didn't Fall For Lindsay Lohan's Falling For Christmas, And Fans Are Divided</a></span></p><p>Thankfully for Lohan, she came into her senses and realized that she had to do something for her mental health. She did something that worked well in her favor; she stepped away from the limelight.</p><p>Being in the entertainment industry, tons of temptation surrounds her and of course, as someone who had a hard time staying sober and clean, she just easily gives in.</p><p>Now that she’s ready to face the world with her much better self, she has partnered with Netflix to facilitate her <a href=#>much awaited comeback to the film industry</a>.</p><h2 id=the-reason-lindsay-lohan-has-never-worked-with-an-acting-coach-prior-to-her-netflix-film>The Reason Lindsay Lohan Has Never Worked With An Acting Coach Prior To Her Netflix Film</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lindsay Lohan is one of the most famous child stars during her prime and most of the early 2000s kids grew up watching her films. Lohan’s impressive acting career produced iconic films such as Parent Trap, Freaky Friday, Mean Girls and a lot more.</p><p>Despite starring in about sixty films in her decades long career, she admitted that she <a href=#>has never worked with an acting coach before</a>.</p><p>Prior to the release of her recent Netflix film, it was revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan has never worked with an acting coach</a> ever. Lohan partnered with Netflix to release a three part film, with the first film titled Falling For Christmas released last November 10, 2022. The first acting coach she has worked with is the distinguished Hollywood acting and life coach, Bernard Hiller.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Was Lindsay Lohan Really Dating Heath Ledger At The Time Of His Death?">Was Lindsay Lohan Really Dating Heath Ledger At The Time Of His Death?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The real reason why she never worked with an acting coach before Hiller is simply because she does not need one. Lohan admitted that even though Hiller is an acting coach, she does not see him as her coach. He’s more of an advisor and mentor for Lohan and that’s the reason why they worked well together.</p><h2 id=how-the-acting-coach-changed-lindsay-lohan-rsquo-s-life>How The Acting Coach Changed Lindsay Lohan’s Life</h2><p>During Lindsay Lohan’s interview for The Hollywood Reporter, <a href=#>she commented that Hiller helped her</a> see what’s not written on the scripts.</p><p>He brings in a different aspect and take on the scenes which resulted in a much better outcome. She was able to portray her character marvelously because of Hiller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She believes that the acting coach changed her life for the better. She added that as soon as she met Hiller, they clicked, and she knew then that she would love to work with him. She immediately hired him as her acting coach and has been working with him since. This is good since Lohan's fans <a href=#>anticipated her comeback to be a massive success</a>.</p><p>The author of The Revolutionary Guide to Acting has helped the actress tremendously. The coach taught her how to take time understanding the dynamics of the project’s story, and just slow every moment in a scene whenever it’s necessary. Lohan admitted that sometimes she just forgets to take her time and analyze each scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdobavsNKasGakn52ur3nSrZirrJWZeri70aSgp59drLa1tIyapWaZk6m2r7OMnKaam5hk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10-celebrities-who-were-forgiven-for-their-horrible-acts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="10 Celebrities Who Were Forgiven For Their Horrible Acts">&larr;
