Because of how successful the first season of the show was, Bravo decided to renew it in new installments and the newest of those is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Girls Trip installment,</a> which is airing on Peacock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same way as all the former seasons, the Ultimate Girls Trip season is also focused on the <strong><a href=#>Real Housewives</a></strong> showing off their glamorous lives as usual infused with as much drama as possible. However, things are a little different here, as the women embark on an alcohol-fueled trip to Turks and Caicos. The season features a specific all-star cast, each of who were chosen for specific reasons. These comprise of Cynthia Bailey, Kenya Moore, Kyle Richards, Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Luann de Lesseps, and Ramona Singer. Here's why these stars were selected.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason ‘RHOBH’ Star Kyle Richards Divorced Her First Husband Guraish Aldjufrie</a></span></p><h2 id=they-are-some-of-the-longest-serving-cast-members-on-the-franchise><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Are Some Of The Longest-Serving Cast Members On The Franchise</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Every Real Housewives fan probably isn’t surprised by the selection of the Housewives for the new installment of the show. Right from <a href=#>RHOBH</a>’s Kyle Richards to Kenya Moore from The Real Housewives of Atlanta, these veterans have been a part of the franchise for several years. Because of this, fans from the different seasons get to enjoy a mash-up show with a mix of different housewives.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Teresa Giudice Really Forgiven Her Fiance’s Controversial Pas</a></span></p><h2 id=a-bonding-experience><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A Bonding Experience</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though all of these stars have been part of The Real Housewives universe since the beginning, most of them haven’t actually spent time with each other. As such, the mash-up provides an opportunity for them to really get to know one another. Although it has proven to be a little challenging, these women appear to be up to the task. It also happens that some of them have run into each other in the past, while some have never been in the same room until now.</p><p><a href=#>Cynthia Bailey</a> had this to say, “I, of course, knew Kenya the most, and I also have a really great close relationship with Luann. I did not know Teresa at all, really; I got to know Melissa a lot more on the trip, and I'd never really hung out with Ramona. Kyle and I have tons of friends in common as well but [had] never hung out-hung out.”</p><h2 id=of-course-the-drama-never-ends><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Of Course, The Drama Never Ends</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like several reality shows have proven, putting a group of people in the same place will always lead to arguments and The Real Housewives of the Ultimate Girls Trip season are no exception. While the all-star cast members were on the cruise and getting to know each other, they had run-ins with one another. For starters, the early stages of the show saw Kyle Richards claiming to not know any the other women well, even though she had met all of them at one point or the other in her life. However, Kenya Moore came with a different story, stating, “Kyle is lying! We slept together 15 years ago!” and then more arguments ensued.</p><h2 id=they-all-have-really-big-personalities><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They All Have Really Big Personalities</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, what is a Real Housewives show without a battle for the best available accommodation? Exactly, that's one of the things that makes the current cast members perfect as they put up such an amazing show. According to Moore, “With [RHOA], it's usually whoever is hosting the trip, they get to select the rooms. In this show, we didn't have someone hosting the trip. You have seven all-stars; you have these big personalities. Everyone wants the master suite, and then there was a room that no one wanted. So it was like, how are we going to figure this out? But it was one of the highlights of the entire show because it was so much drama!”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip' Kenya And Ramona Fight On Day One</a></span></p><h2 id=they-come-bringing-glamour-and-class><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Come Bringing Glamour and Class</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing that doesn’t slip up in a The Real Housewives show is their signature lifestyle of <a href=#>wealth and class</a>, which they make a point to show off at every opportunity they have. Over the years, these women have thrived on flaunting their flamboyant and expensive way of life. Right from flying in private jets to their designer outfits, these Housewives always manage to become the center of wherever they are.</p><h2 id=they-have-more-in-common-than-they-know><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Have More In Common Than They Know</span></h2><p>One thing that led to the selection of this specific group of women besides their talents is that they individually have a lot more in common than they think. As such, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo </a>has made it a point to show them just how much they are similar. In as much as the cast member are generally free on regular episodes of The Real Housewives show, they do have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couple of rules</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of these set out rules requires them to ignore the elephant in the room, which in this case, are Bravo cameras. However, on the Ultimate Girls Trip, the women are completely free from rules and not obligated to deny the presence of cameras. In the words of Luann de Lesseps concerning, they utter freedom of expression, “It was great because we got to talk about the things that we all have to go through. We're all Housewives, but we all, at the end of the day, are women with our lives. We shared so much about ourselves.” It created a space for the women where they can be comfortable talking about the similar problems they face as reality stars. The show cuts across the lives of the different reality stars and how they relate to one another, making the cast member the perfect choice.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Are 'The Real Housewives' In Dubai?
