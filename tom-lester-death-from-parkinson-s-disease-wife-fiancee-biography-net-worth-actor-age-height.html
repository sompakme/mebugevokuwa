She suggested he begin work in the Little Theater, which he did, acting in showcases at the North Hollywood Playhouse. In the early 1960s, Lester performed in a play with CBS producer Paul Henning’s daughter Linda Kaye Henning (Betty Jo Bradley of Petticoat Junction), and Lester soon found himself auditioning for the role of Eb Dawson on Green Acres. Lester beat 400 other actors to play the character after a screen test.</p><p>He got the role because he was the only one who could milk a cow in real life since he grew up on a farm in Mississippi. His recurring role soon became a regular character due to the character’s and the show’s popularity, which made Lester a household name.</p><p>Green Acres was the 11th-rated show in its debut season of 1965–66, according to the Nielsen ratings, climbed to #6 in 1966-67 and was #16 and #19, respectively, the following two seasons. As Green Acres characters also appeared in episodes of two other CBS series – Petticoat Junction and The Beverly Hillbillies – Lester, as Eb Dawson, also occasionally appeared on those shows.</p><p>Even during the height of Green Acres’ popularity, Lester lived in a small apartment atop a garage in the San Fernando Valley. Each year during the show’s summer hiatus he would travel the country and speak at churches, youth rallies, and revival meetings and at one time was part of the Rev. Billy Graham’s organization.</p><p>Lester appeared in nearly every Green Acres episode between 1965–71, with the exception of the first half in the 1967–68 season when he suffered mononucleosis. The show’s explanation for Eb’s absence was that he had eloped and was on his honeymoon. After six seasons, Green Acres was cancelled in 1971 as part of CBS’s “rural purge”.</p><h2 class=mol-img><span class=ez-toc-section id=tom-lester-net-worth></span><span>Tom Lester Net Worth</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p align=justify>Tom has enjoyed a long career in his acting industry.

In 1990, he reunited with Albert and Gabor to reprise his role in Return to Green Acres.</p><p>He returned to his parents’ home in Laurel, Mississippi, but continued to do an occasional movie or TV role. During the mid-1970s to early 1980s, his roles included guest spots in Little House on the Prairie, Marcus Welby, M.D., Knight Rider and Love, American Style.

Moses and Steven Curtis Chapman). In 2014, he starred with Ray Stevens and Victoria Jackson in the comedy Campin’ Buddies.</p><p>Lester was a farmer and for many years had been a Christian speaker who traveled the nation, preaching a message of faith and obedience. He still participated in autograph shows and fan forums, often dressed as Eb Dawson. In 1997, Lester was the recipient of Mississippi’s “Wildlife Farmer of the Year” award.</p><p>With the death of Mary Grace Canfield on February 15, 2014, who portrayed Ralph Monroe, Lester was the last surviving regular cast member of Green Acres.</p><h2 class=mol-para-with-font><span class=ez-toc-section id=tom-lester-early-life></span><span>Tom Lester Early Life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font>Originally from Laurel, Mississippi, where he was raised on his grandfather’s farm, Lester had big dreams for Hollywood. But not everyone in town thought he could make it. ‘I told them I was going out to Hollywood to become an actor and they all said, “You’re crazy,”‘ he remembered in an interview with&nbsp;Faith Forward.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You’ll never be able to do that. You’re too tall, too skinny, too ugly. You’ve got a Southern accent and you’ll never make it in the motion picture business. You don’t look like Rock Hudson.’ The criticism discouraged him from heading to Los Angeles.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-tom-lester></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About Tom Lester</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-tom-lester></span>Who is Tom Lester?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Thomas William Lester (September 23, 1938 – April 20, 2020) was an American actor and evangelist, best known for his role as Eb Dawson, farmhand to Oliver Wendell Douglas (played by Eddie Albert) on the television series Green Acres.
