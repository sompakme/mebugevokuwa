Several television show finales throughout the years have seemed like wonderful farewells to the characters fans have come to love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Others might have left fans wanting a better way to say goodbye, while still other shows seem to have either completely divided the fanbase of a popular show, or angered and <a href=#>disappointed fans for how a beloved show came to an end</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus Still Gets Emotional Remembering Her Last Day Backstage On Seinfeld</a></span></p><p>It seems many Seinfeld fans wanted a different type of ending for "the show about nothing." Celebrities who play certain characters that their fans connect to seem to have varying opinions about how their shows have ended. Apparently Wayne Knight didn't shy away from his true feelings related to the "disappointing" Seinfeld finale.</p><h2 id=what-has-wayne-knight-said-about-39-seinfeld-39>What Has Wayne Knight Said About 'Seinfeld'?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Newman-Jerry-On-Seinfeld.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wayne Knight has gotten tons of laughs for playing Newman on Seinfeld. The character is a friend of Cosmo Kramer who is also Jerry Seinfeld's mail-carrier and arch-nemesis.</p><p>Although Knight was a recurring character rather than a series regular, his unforgettable appearance in the role has seemed to make him a memorable character for many fans.</p><p>During an interview with Vice, Knight <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed his thoughts about the show.</a> Asked why he thinks the show "has sustained for so long" the JFK actor said, "First of all, it was a d***** good show. And it was also very iconoclastic and bizarre in the sense that it was depicting people, New Yorkers especially, more as they are than as they wish they were."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing he added, "A lot of comedy and a lot of TV is wish fulfillment where you'll see families and hugs and lessons and idealized people. And there was nobody idealized on Seinfeld. They were all venal, selfish, self-absorbed, and crazy. And they were wonderfully recognizable because of that. They were like real people."</p><p>It appears Wayne Knight enjoyed his time on the show. However, <a href=#>not every celebrity who made an appearance on Seinfeld seemed to like working on the show</a>. The Jurassic Park actor appeared on the show until its last season. Several characters who had appeared on the show returned for the two-part finale, titled The Finale, which reportedly had 76 million viewers.</p><h2 id=what-did-wayne-knight-say-about-the-finale>What Did Wayne Knight Say About The Finale?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar47722347-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not everyone was happy with the Seinfeld season finale. According to ShowbizCheatSheet, Vulture reported that the two-part finale, "seemed to be deliberately provoking the viewers to hate them and question whether the years they spent watching the series were wasted."</p><p><a href=#>There have been some shows that have had great endings</a>. Unfortunately many excellent shows have seemed to be unable to find a way to come to a satisfying conclusion for viewers.</p><p>According to ComicBook, Wayne <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Knight discussed his feelings about the Seinfeld finale</a> at Pennsylvania's Steel City Convention. "I think I'm like the rest of the public as far as the finale goes. I don't think you can end that show in a way that would work."</p><p>Knight continued, "The idea of doing a retrospective winds up feeling like a clip show, so I think that they tried to pay tribute to all of the people who had walked through that set, all the great performances, all the great people. And it didn't quite land in the way that they wanted."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Hail, Caesar! actor also added that series creator Larry David "wanted to show that these people (the core cast) are not deserving of any glory. He wanted them to have the worst time possible. And as a concept, that works, but I don't know if it works as a finale."</p><p>In the show's finale the four main characters, Jerry Seinfeld, Elaine Benes, George Costanza and Cosmo Kramer are sent to prison.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Craziest Seinfeld Fan Theories</a></span></p><p>During a Reddit Q&A, Jerry Seinfeld wrote, "I was happy with the Seinfeld finale because we didn't want to do another episode as much as we wanted to have everybody come back to the show we had so much fun with."</p><p>According to Looper, discussing the finale at a later time, Seinfeld said, "I sometimes think we really shouldn't have even done it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-seinfeld-come-to-an-end>Why Did Seinfeld Come To An End?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Untitled-design-(71).jpg><p>Viewers seemed to love watching Seinfeld throughout its nine seasons. <a href=#>Although the show was still popular during the last season</a>, Jerry Seinfeld and others decided the show should come to an end.</p><p>According to Esquire, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seinfeld discussed the decision to end Seinfeld at a press conference</a>. "I remember when I was in the ninth season and I was thinking maybe it's time to wrap this up, and I remember inviting Micahel [Richards] and Julia [Louis-Dreyfus] and Jason [Alexander] to my dressing room and we all just sat there and we stared at each other."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Continuing the comedian added, "We've had a lot of good fortune here. Maybe we shouldn't push our luck too far. And we all agreed that this was the right moment. And I remember it's the only time we all got together in a dressing room, the four of us, to make that decision. That was powerful."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How The Beatles Inspired Jerry Seinfeld To End His Legendary Sitcom After Nine Seasons</a></span></p><p>According to HuffPost, Jason Alexander, who played George Costanza said, "The mutual thought was, 'Why don't we tuck it in before the audience says this kid's been up too long."</p><p>It seems Jerry Seinfeld wanted to end the show while it was popular. According to Esquire, Jerry Seinfeld was asked by a cab driver, "Why did you stop doing that show?"</p><p>The comedian answered, "And I said to him, well, I was at a point we had done it for nine years and I realized I could go off the air right now and the show could be a legend. I could be a legend of the sitcom world or I could make some more money."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSixc2eZKSmmZy1tXnToaaun5ipeqKuzq6rZqyYmnq0scinnZ6klGKzqrrApZxo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-really-happened-between-matty-healy-and-his-ex-girlfriend-halsey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Really Happened Between Matty Healy And His Ex-Girlfriend Halsey?">&larr;
