In addition, we'll take a look at how much the actor is worth today.</p><h2 id=will-friedle-39-s-big-career-break-took-place-as-eric-matthews-on-39-boy-meets-world-39>Will Friedle's Big Career Break Took Place As Eric Matthews On 'Boy Meets World'</h2><p>When we think of the name Will Friedle, fans instantly think of his work on 'Boy Meets World' for seven seasons, as a part of the iconic TGIF lineup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He started off on the gig as a teen in 1993, and it would span all the way up until the rest of the '90s, ending in 2000. As the actor revealed alongside Celebrity Nine, he still has fond memories of the show, and according to sitcom star, <a href=#>it was just as much fun to shoot behind the scenes.</a></p><p>"While it was a big part of people's lives during the '90s, it was still just a half hour a week for the fans. For us, it was 24/7 for seven years. This was a show that was at a certain port in our lives that was so important to all of us. I was 16 when it started. Ben [Savage, who played Cory] was 11 when I met him. Danielle [Fishel, who played Topanga] was 11 when I met her. We really were like a family. It was an absolutely formidable part of growing up, and we did it together and we did it in front of a camera."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This 'Boy Meets World' Theory Changes Everything About Eric</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will be happy to know that the cast still keeps in contact thanks to a group chat. Will revealed that he frequently talks to the main stars of the show, including Ben Savage, Danielle Fishel and Rider Strong.</p><p>Although his contributions to the show won't be forgotten, the actor did a lot more in the years that followed.</p><h2 id=will-friedle-has-kept-extremely-busy-since-the-39-90s-sitcom-in-both-tv-and-film-projects>Will Friedle Has Kept Extremely Busy Since The '90s Sitcom In Both TV And Film Projects</h2><p>'Boy Meets World' was a huge role, however, the actor would go on to more work, and in addition, he would make quite the splash in his personal life, dating Jennifer Love Hewitt at one point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for his career, Will would work several projects on both TV and film. These days, according to IMDb, <a href=#>he's especially busy with voice over work</a>, on Marvel and DC shows such as 'DC Super Hero Girls' and the video game voice over for 'Marvel Dimension of Heroes'.</p><p>While Friedle is proud to be a part of such projects, he revealed alongside Cosplay and Coffee that <a href=#>he wouldn't be all to comfortable joining the team as himself,</a> "I’m part of the Marvel world with Star-Lord on Guardians of the Galaxy in the animated series. But you have to be in really good shape to be in those movies. You don’t want to see me in spandex, I can promise you that. So yeah, I’m not sure I would be too good. Unless maybe it was the funny guy who was the friend of the superhero."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>The 'Boy Meets' World Episodes That Were Banned From The Disney Channel</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also worked as a voice actor once again in 2021 on 'American Dad!'. It seems like the celebrity has found great success in his mid-40s in voice over work. Given his consistency and constant projects, it is no wonder his net worth has stayed steady.</p><h2 id=will-friedle-39-s-current-net-worth-sits-at-500-000>Will Friedle's Current Net Worth Sits At $500,000</h2><p>At the moment, Will Friedle's net worth remains at $500,000, which is quite the chunk of change. Given his constant appearance at fan conventions, along with interviews, voice over work and other TV and film acting projects, this number should only go up in the years to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans have also been pushing for an Eric Matthews spin-off in the recent years, given how great his cameo was on 'Girl Meets World' the reboot.
