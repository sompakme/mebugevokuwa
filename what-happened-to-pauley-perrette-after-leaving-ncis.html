Fifty-three-year-old Perrette's exit at the end of season 15 of NCIS came as a shock to fans.On the show, her character resigned after an assassination attempt, but according to multiple reports, the real reason she left was due to a falling out the actress had with lead actor Mark Harmon. This rumor was only heightened when Abby's farewell to his character, Gibbs, via a letter but to the other colleagues in person.Since leaving the show, Pauley Perrette appeared on a short-lived comedy and since then has retired. Recently, it was revealed she suffered from some serious health issues but was currently doing better.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pauley-perrette-is-best-known-for-playing-abby-sciuto-on-ncis><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Pauley Perrette Is Best Known For Playing Abby Sciuto On NCIS</span></h2><p>Pauley Perrette was known for playing quirky forensic scientist Abby Sciuto in the long-running procedural show.
