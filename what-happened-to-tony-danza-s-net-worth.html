We'll take a look at how the actor thrived on both TV and film. We'll also examine his investments outside of acting that helped to boost net worth. Though he did have some situations that might've set back his bank account.</p><p>Let's take a look at his career and where his net worth currently stands.</p><h2 id=tony-danza-39-s-acting-career-was-almost-cut-short-in-the-39-90s>Tony Danza's Acting Career Was Almost Cut Short In The '90s</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tony Danza went through a major career upgrade during the late '70s when he was cast in 'Taxi', playing the role of Tony Banta. He enjoyed more success in the mid-'80s thanks to another TV series, this one on 'Who's the Boss?' which lasted up until '92.</p><p>During the '90s however, Danza's personal life took a tough turn, as not only did his mother pass away, <a href=#>but he also faced huge injury issues after being involved in a life-threatening ski accident</a>. One that almost ended his acting career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Think Danny Devito Raised Mara Wilson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor hit a tree at a high speed and was left in critical condition for an entire month. He suffered a few broken ribs, two shattered vertebrae and a punctured lung.</p><p>Not only did the injury threaten his career but as he revealed alongside Dr. Oz, it was emotionally stressful as well behind the scenes.</p><p>"The reason I fell…is because I [had] lost my mother in June, it was the first Christmas and I had her in my mind. Every Christmas you go through this thing where you miss the people who aren’t there anymore... I'm sorry folks, I didn’t mean for this to [happen]. I’m just a bit of a crybaby."</p><p>Although Danza wanted to sell the place and give up skiing, he would muster the courage to revisit the area of the injury, while rekindling his passion for skiing. Thankfully, it all worked out, and his career was able to continue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=acting-and-real-estate-helped-skyrocket-tony-danza-39-s-net-worth>Acting And Real Estate Helped Skyrocket Tony Danza's Net Worth</h2><p>Prior to acting, Danza already had quite the resume, attending college thanks to a wrestling scholarship.

His audition was a success and that would launch his career, with 'Who's the Boss?' becoming his next big role. Danza's net worth is only expected to skyrocket even further, with the 'Who's the Boss' reboot currently in the works.

His relationship with Tracy Robinson was a lengthy one starting in 1986, though almost three decades later in 2013, the two would also call it quits.</p><p>In terms of profit, Danza would make some extra bucks thanks to real estate. In 2014, it was reported that he sold his stunning Malibu beach home, after it was on the market for three years. Danza made one heck of a profit, selling the place for $8 million, this after purchasing the property for just over $1 million in 1987, when his career really started to take off.</p><p>With all this success both in and out of acting, it is no wonder his worth remains extremely high.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tony-danza-is-worth-40-million-in-2022>Tony Danza Is Worth $40 Million In 2022</h2><p>Set to turn 71 in April, Tony Danza is doing just fine nowadays, with a great net worth of $40 million.</p><p>Not only does he have a reboot in the near future, but <a href=#>he also has other credits in the recent years</a>, including the voice of Siggy in 'Rumble' back in 2021, along with playing the role of Jay in the TV series 'Outmatched.'</p><p>Kudos to the actor for keeping busy after all these years while maintaining a strong net worth, thanks to work in and out of acting.</p><p><span class=related-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Fans Think This Was Danny DeVito's Best Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKapYrGiutmaZKedpGLEsL7ToWSipl1nfXN%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-ed-cooley-wife-and-children-providence-basketball-coach-family-details.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Ed Cooley Wife And Children?
