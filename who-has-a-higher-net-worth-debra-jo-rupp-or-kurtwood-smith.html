The reboot of the popular Fox sitcom That ‘70s Show has been <a href=#>received with generally positive reviews</a> from critics, with an approval rating of 74% on Rotten Tomatoes. One critical review describes the show as being “way better than it has any right to be.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The main cast of That ‘90s Show consists of mostly new characters, with <a href=#>the likes of Callie Haverda</a>, Ashley Aufderheide, Mace Coronel, Reyn Doi and Sam Morelos among the newcomers. <a href=#>Some old faces also make a welcome return</a>, however. Husband and wife duo Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis – who first met on the set of That ‘70s Show — are among the returnees, although their <a href=#>experience filming the reboot was quite different</a> than the original.</p><p>Topher Grace, Laura Prepon and Wilmer Valderrama also make a return, albeit in recurring roles. The two characters from That ‘70s Show who are also a main part of the new series are Red and Kitty Forman, now grandparents to Haverda’s character, Leia Forman.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What That '70s Show Cast Thinks Of Netflix's Reboot, That '90s Show</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith played the roles of Red and Kitty in the original show, and returned in the same capacity in the reboot.

Their stature — not just in the industry — but also as cast members from the parent series is reportedly recognized with the highest salaries.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Showbiz Galore</a> , the seasoned pair received a remuneration of $60,000 per episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That amount is double the next highest on the list, with lead star Callie Haverda on a reported $30,000 per episode. Ashley Aufderheide and Mace Coronel are said to be on $20,000 per episode, with Maxwell Acee Donovan and Reyn Doi receiving $15,000 per episode.

The actress made her Broadway debut in the play Cat on a Hot Tin Roof by Tennessee Williams in 1990. She featured as the character Mae, previously portrayed by Madeleine Sherwood, Daphne Anderson and Joan Pape.</p><p>Rupp’s other most notable stage roles include To Kill a Mockingbird, The Cake, Becoming Dr. Ruth and Dr. Ruth, All the Way. In addition to her stage work, the Massachusetts-born star has also had a successful career in television. She has enjoyed a number of notable guest appearances on shows such as <a href=#><strong>Seinfeld</strong></a>, The Ranch, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, <a href=#><strong>Friends</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>The Office</strong></a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which That '70s Show Cast Member Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rupp has become something of a TV specialist, but she has also appeared in a number of films over the years. Her big screen credits include movies like She Wants Me, She's Out of My League, Jackson and Kickin' It Old Skool. For this entire portfolio of work, she has managed to amass <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a net worth of $5 million</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><h2 id=is-kurtwood-smith-richer-than-debra-jo-rupp>Is Kurtwood Smith Richer Than Debra Jo Rupp?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kurtwood-smith.jpg><p>Kurtwood Smith forged his acting career in plays, much in the same way as his co-star Debra Jo Rupp. Among the roles he has taken on stage are in various productions of Billy Budd, Idiot's Delight and Green Grow the Lilacs, among others. On the screen, he started out in the early ‘80s by featuring in movies like Roadie, Staying Alive and Flashpoint, as well as the TV shows Soap, Lou Grant and The Renegades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smith’s breakout role came in the 1987 film RoboCop, where he played the character Clarence Boddicker. In the years since its release, the film has achieved cult status and the character of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Boddicker is considered one of the most iconic</a> and memorable villains in science fiction film history. Other major movie roles of Smith’s career include in Dead Poets Society, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Broken Arrow, and A Time to Kill.</p><p>On television, other than That ‘70s Show, Smith is best known for his portrayal of the characters Dick Clayton in Worst Week, Senator Blaine Mayer in 24 and Lt. James Gordon in <a href=#><strong>DC</strong></a>’s animated series Beware the Batman. By January 2023, Celebrity Net Worth estimated that the actor had accrued <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a net worth of $10 million</a>, exactly double that of his colleague and friend, Rupp.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddna60ecBmn6KfmJq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptW6wxJupmmWapHqzwc%2BpZKiqXaDCs8DWqKadZaOitrW0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-boogie-wit-da-hoodie-lands-first-no-1-album-with-hoodie-szn.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie Lands First No. 1 Album With 'Hoodie SZN'">&larr;
