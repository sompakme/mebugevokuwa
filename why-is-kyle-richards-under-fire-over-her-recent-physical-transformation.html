One of the most explosive ones was <a href=#>her rift with Garcelle Beauvais</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In season 12, Erika Jayne cursed at the latter's son at her birthday party. She told him to "get the f*ck out of here." Richards, her husband Mauricio Umansky, as well as Dorit Kemsley and her husband Paul Kemsley were all seen laughing at the incident.</p><p>"You'd think after 12 years I would know better, but we screwed up, I did. I messed up," Richards said after watching the scene. "My husband and I both, of course, apologized to Garcelle."</p><p>When she's not trending over feuds, the <a href=#>former child actor</a> often goes viral over her physical transformation. Like recently, fans slammed her for her "Ozempic" weight loss.</p><p>Rumored to have had plastic surgery, the <a href=#>famous aunt of Paris Hilton</a> shocked fans when she posted snaps of her skinny figure on Instagram. "I'd rather be a lonely lion than a popular sheep," she wrote in the caption. Here's the truth about her latest look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Kyle Richards' Insane Net Worth Come From The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills Or Real Estate?</a></span></p><h2 id=has-kyle-richards-had-plastic-surgery>Has Kyle Richards Had Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>In 2021, Richards told InTouch Magazine, "I'm not looking to have any other surgery" after admitting to just getting a nose job that unfortunately got botched. "People keep asking me if I've done anything but I haven't," she continued. "I haven't even had Botox recently, because I want to be able to move my forehead in movies to show expression, like in Halloween Kills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two months before that, she took to her Instagram Stories to prove that the only work she had done on her face was rhinoplasty. "Since so many of you were speculating what I did or did not do to my face...here is your answer. I fixed my nose," she wrote. "I broke it last September and the bone poking out bothered me. So I fixed the bone, fixed my breathing problems and refined the tip."</p><p>She also noted to fans: "I will always tell you guys the truth. I do think some of the comments on my posts are funny though." The reality star had previously confessed to trying Botox and getting Liposuction once in the past, but nothing further. As for her facial glow-up, she said her secret was PRP which is an injection of plasma rich in platelets from the patient's own blood.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Plans For RHONY: Legacy Became So Complicated</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-have-fans-said-about-kyle-richards-39-recent-weight-loss>What Have Fans Said About Kyle Richards' Recent Weight Loss?</h2><p>In January 2023, Reddit user claimed: "Kyle Richards on the Ozempic train with the rest of Hollywood." Commenters didn't doubt the allegation, with one saying that "It's just so obvious. All these women who have been a certain size for decades and then all of a sudden, in their 40s/50s, they drop down to a 00?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/fsrbgdwxsaioidj.jpeg><p>They continued: "That's just not how weight works (unless you have an eating disorder, and even then it's not a guarantee)." The same Redditor clarified that although there's "no [judgment] at all, it's just obvious that these celebrities are using this drug, but using the [Kardashian] technique of showing themselves in the gym so people think it's natural, when clearly it's not."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another critic weighed in, saying that "at least Kyle has muscle tone, she IS exercising" while "the Kardashians have none." But the biggest concern among people is that Richards is one of the many celebrities "taking meds away from diabetics (there's a shortage)" as the Ozempic is primarily an antidiabetic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kyle Richards' Daughters Are All Grown Up, What Are They Doing Now?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-has-kyle-richards-said-about-the-ozempic-rumors>What Has Kyle Richards Said About The Ozempic Rumors?</h2><p>Soon as the Ozempic rumors started, Richards told fellow Housewives, Teddi Mellencamp and Tamra Judge on their podcast, Two Ts In A Pod that she had simply improved her diet. "After gaining weight during the summer — on July 15 — after getting off the boat I said 'That is it. I'm not having any sugar, any carbs, any alcohol,'" she said of her weight gain in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kyle-richards.jpg><p>She also set the record straight on the accusations, saying: "A lot of people think I've been taking Ozempic. To clarify I've never taken Ozempic." She noted that she "had never heard of it" but "had heard of it when they accused me, but I'd already lost weight by the time I had heard about Ozempic, so it was really frustrating to me."</p><p>She continued: "What I don't want to get lost in this is that I want to be able to inspire people. I stopped drinking almost seven months ago, I don't eat bad, sugar, pizza, donuts, carbs … so I'd rather be inspiring than people making up stories about me." Richards also argued that critics shouldn't discredit her lifestyle change which includes working out "two hours every day."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a> </strong>— who was also speculated to be using the drug — clapped back with the same line: "Let's not discredit my years of working out. I get up 5 days a week at 6am to train." Amid the scandal, Rosie O'Donnell spilled that people in Los Angeles have been having "Ozempic parties."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsBut9ilnGaqmZi1or7DrGSuppSav26yyKucZqemmr9utMSrZKudk5q7tXnPobCsoZOWuW7A0ZqlrJ6fp7qiwMiopWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./will-smith-s-ex-girlfriend-is-a-major-reason-for-his-career-changing-role-in-the-fresh-prince-of-bel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Smith's Ex-Girlfriend Is A Major Reason For His Career-Changing Role In The Fresh Prince Of Bel">&larr;
