The group received their first Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988). But though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which earned the pair their second Grammy.With success, Smith spent money more freely and around 1988 and 1989 he underpaid his income taxes. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internal Revenue Service</a> eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against him. Many of his possessions were taken to pay off his debt. Smith admitted that he had to borrow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10,000 from a drug dealer</a> when he became broke.Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom around him.

"Will had to spend a night in the cell at the West Philadelphia police station with other inmates waking him up all night long and asking for his autograph. It was the worst night of his life.

There he met record executive and talent manager, Benny Medina, the man who “Fresh Prince” was based on. Smith was invited to meet legendary music producer Quincy Jones who handed Smith a screenplay. He asked him to audition for the lead role of Fresh Prince on the spot. The rapper asked for a few weeks to prepare for the role to which Jones replied, “you could take 10 minutes right now, and you could change your life forever.”</p><p>Needless to say, Smith won the role and the rest is history. “The moral of the story is always say yes. And I guess, listen to your girlfriend,” Smith told his almost 10 million YouTube followers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=will-smith-calls-his-acting-in-the-first-few-episodes-of-fresh-prince-terrible>Will Smith Calls His Acting In The First Few Episodes Of 'Fresh Prince' 'Terrible'</h2><p>Will Smith had no acting experience before he took on the role on the Fresh Prince.
